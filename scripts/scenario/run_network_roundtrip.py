"""Measure PC→device→PC round-trip latency per protocol on the checked boards.

The simplest honest latency probe: the PC sends one solid-colour frame to a
device, then times how long until that colour shows up in the device's preview
WebSocket stream. The path is PC → device's NetworkReceiveEffect (writes the
layer buffer) → PreviewDriver (broadcasts the buffer over /ws) → PC. It sweeps
all three protocols — ArtNet, E1.31, DDP — per device (the receiver autodetects
each on its own port, so no reconfig between them), and prints a per-device
median-per-protocol comparison. Runs against every device CHECKED in MoonDeck's
Live tab (the `selected` flag); `--host` overrides to a single explicit device.
Works with as few as one board reachable.

Deliberately minimal. The measured time includes the PreviewDriver's own
rate-limit (default 24 fps ≈ up to 42 ms of quantisation), so treat the number
as "state-change visible within" latency, not wire latency — raise the device's
Preview fps to tighten it. Across repeats the spread (min/median/max) is the
useful signal for the hiccups/latency symptom.

Extend later (hooks left intentionally simple): per-frame sequence matching,
the device→device forwarding chain, jitter/drop histograms. This version sweeps
the three protocols with one probe colour, N repeats each.

Exit codes follow the other live scripts: 0 = measured ok, 1 = no frame came
back (a real failure), 2 = environment problem (no device, moondeck.json
missing).

Run:  uv run scripts/scenario/run_network_roundtrip.py [--host IP] [--repeats N]
