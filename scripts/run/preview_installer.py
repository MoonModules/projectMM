"""Locally preview the web installer at docs/install/index.html.

Stages a small directory (the install page + the shared install-picker
module) and serves it with `python -m http.server`, plus the
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header that GitHub Pages serves on its
static assets by default — needed so the device UI's
`consumePendingBoardParam` can cross-origin-fetch a localhost-served
boards.json the same way it would fetch the production one. Two modes
depending on what's been built locally:

  - **render-only** (no `build/esp32-*/projectMM.bin` present): the
    picker populates against the real GitHub Releases API, dropdowns
    work, but clicking Install fails because the local server has no
    `releases/` tree. Equivalent to "Recipe A" in docs/install/README.md.
    Useful for iterating on HTML/CSS/JS without tagging a release.

  - **flash-ready** (at least one local ESP32 build exists): the
    script additionally stages every `build/esp32-*/projectMM.bin` it
    finds into `releases/local-dev/` and generates matching Pages-
    relative manifests via generate_manifest.py — the same code path
    .github/workflows/release.yml uses. The picker shows `local-dev`
    as the newest release; clicking Install flashes the chip + opens
    the ESP Web Tools Improv WiFi modal, end-to-end.

The flash-ready mode is the developer's test ground for the install
flow before deploying to GitHub Pages: any change to the installer
page or install-picker.js can be verified against a real ESP32 over
`http://localhost:8000/` (Web Serial works on localhost without the
secure-origin requirement that gates the public site).

Long-running. MoonDeck shows a Stop button while this is up; pressing
Stop kills the python process (matched by script name via pkill).
