"""Run the host test suites: the Python ones, the JS ones, or both.

These are the tests that live outside the C++ binary, and they cover what it cannot reach: the
cross-language contracts (the Improv frame's wire format, WLED's /json shape), the MoonDeck scripts
themselves, the browser code in src/ui, and the claim that every shipped MoonLive script is valid
C++. The commit gate and CI both run them; this is the same command with a card in front of it.

  uv run moondeck/test/test_host.py            # both suites
  uv run moondeck/test/test_host.py --python   # just Python
  uv run moondeck/test/test_host.py --js       # just JS
  uv run moondeck/test/test_host.py --ui       # just the UI run (needs a running device)

The Python deps ride in a PEP-723 block per test file, so they are named here rather than
installed: `uv run --with` resolves them per run and leaves no environment behind.
