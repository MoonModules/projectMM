"""Prose rules, enforced on ADDED lines through Vale.

The rules are stated in docs/documentation-standards.md and live as YAML under .vale/styles/,
one file per rule, so the standard and its check share one vocabulary. This script owns the one
thing Vale cannot: SCOPE. It walks the git diff and feeds Vale only what a change adds, because
the tree holds thousands of pre-existing violations and a whole-file gate would fail every commit
until a sweep larger than any change. Converting as files are touched reaches the same end state
without that.

An ERROR (em-dash, spelling, "e.g.") blocks; a warning or suggestion informs. Wired as a
write-time hook (hook_prose.py) so a fix happens while the sentence is still in mind, and again
at the commit gate. Without vale on PATH the check skips with a notice rather than failing.

TEMPORARY. This script and hook_prose.py exist only to keep the gate honest while the tree
holds inherited violations. Once `vale docs/ CLAUDE.md README.md` exits clean, delete both
and let .github/workflows/prose.yml check whole files.
