# `markdown` because this check renders a row through the BUILD's own renderer rather than

# MkDocs supplies it at build time; a bare `uv run` of this script does not.
"""The documentation the build GENERATES, held to the standards that describe it.

Two surfaces, one check, because they are one pipeline: the hand-written catalog pages
that render as card tables, and the `///` comments in the sources that become the
technical pages beside them. A rule about the first is a rule about a cell width; a rule
about the second is a rule doxygen enforces by silently dropping what it cannot read.
Prose is NOT here: em-dashes, spelling and weasel words are Vale's, and a second prose
checker is the thing the documentation sweep exists to delete.

A card is one table row, and a row is read across. Text that outgrows its cell turns the
column into a ribbon: at the worst, 3,416 characters of description in a cell 44% of the
page wide. The rule and its limits are in documentation-standards.md § The card; this
script owns the measuring.

Where the overflow goes is the point, and there are exactly two homes:

  * Behavior of the module itself -> the `///` comments in its .h, which reach the reader
    through the generated technical page the card already links. Free, and it cannot drift
    from the code it sits beside.
  * Rationale spanning modules, or guidance a user needs before choosing -> a
    `## <Name>, details` section under the same page, which the build links as
    `⌄ details`. documentation-standards.md forbids a per-module detail page, and this
    section is what it offers instead.

Parsing is the BUILD's parser (mkdocs_hooks._render_catalog_table's block loop), imported
rather than reimplemented: a second parser of the same format is the drift this check exists
to prevent.

Pinned by test/python/test_check_docgen.py. A check like this fails silently when it
breaks: a regex that stops matching prints a clean run, which reads exactly like a tree
with nothing wrong in it. So every rule here is tested firing on a page built to break it,
not only staying quiet on one that obeys.

# A card is read across a row; a member comment is read beside the thing it describes,

# line, and a deep dive goes after `@moreinfo` where a post-process moves it below the
# member lists. The word cap is 30: a sentence is one thought and past twenty it is
# usually two, but that is writing advice, and a gate stops a commit only on a real
# ramble. Measured over the tree, 20 fired on the median sentence and 30 leaves the
# outliers alone. Vale's SentenceLength carries the same 30 as a suggestion.
