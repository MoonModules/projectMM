"""Mechanical projectMM -> MoonLight rename sweep (dry-run by default).

The one-shot transition tool for [docs/work/future/rename-to-moonlight.md] Phase 1
step 4. Replaces the product-name token everywhere it is the *current* name,
while leaving the references that must NOT change: the predecessor "MoonLight"
prose/links (already repointed to ewowi/MoonLight), the MoonLive scripting
engine (a different name), and the docs/history era record (which keeps saying
projectMM by the present-tense history exception).

Run it NOW against today's tree to harden the exclude list and review the diff,
but DRY-RUN ONLY until the switch — the externally-visible identifiers (binary
name, mDNS prefix, repo URL, library.json name) must flip *at* the switch, lined
up with the first release under the new repo (see the plan's Phase 2/3).

ORDERING: the sweep also rewrites the repo URL (MoonModules/projectMM ->
MoonModules/MoonLight) and the docs host (moonmodules.org/projectMM). Per the
plan that is correct ONLY when run *after* the repo rename (Phase 3.2): the URL
becomes MoonModules/MoonLight, which only resolves once this repo holds that
name. So --apply belongs in Phase 3.3, after 3.2 — not before.

  uv run moondeck/repo_rename/rename_to_moonlight.py            # dry-run: list every hit, change nothing
  uv run moondeck/repo_rename/rename_to_moonlight.py --apply    # WRITE the changes (switch-day only)

Why a script and not a bare `sed`: the value here is not clever per-form logic
(a plain token replace is correct for every form — repo URL, host path,
binary basename, product name, deviceName slug all just contain the token), it
is the EXCLUDE LIST + the dry-run review + the binary/.git guards. Verified
against today's tree: `projectMM` is never a substring of another token, and the
rename touches neither `MoonLight` nor `MoonLive`, so those are safe by
construction — the only deliberate handling is the capitalised enum token
`ProjectMM` and the path exclusions below.

Exit 1 if a dry-run finds hits (so CI / a pre-switch check can assert "still
references to flip"); exit 0 when clean (post-switch, nothing left).
