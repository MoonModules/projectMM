"""Generate per-module technical Markdown from source, at MkDocs build time.

The source `.h` is the single home of technical content; these pages are generated
*views* of the `///` comments in it — nothing is hand-restated. Pipeline: Doxygen
(the de-facto-standard parser — robust on the C++20 that a Tree-sitter tool choked
on) emits XML; moxygen renders it to Markdown with our custom template
(moondeck/docs/moxygen-templates/). Called by mkdocs_hooks.py's on_files, the output
injected into the virtual tree under moonmodules/{core,light}/moxygen/<Module>.md —
the domain-nested layout the § Documentation model standard defines.

**Every** `.h` under src/{core,light} gets a page — core and light, module and
utility alike. Discovery is exhaustive and automatic (no hand-maintained list): a
richly-`///`-commented header yields a full page, a sparsely-commented one a thin
page. Curation is a *separate* layer: only MoonModule subclasses (the things with
controls) appear in the end-user summary tables; a non-module header (a wire-format
struct, a math utility) has no table row but is still reachable as a generated page
and cross-linked from the pages that use it. Catalog effects/modifiers/layouts/
drivers get a page from their `///` too; their *controls* surface stays in the
summary-page cards, since those come from runtime `controls_.add(...)` calls no
static tool sees.

Doxygen (a brew/apt binary) and moxygen (via npx) are NOT uv-installable — the one
justified non-uv dependency (like the ESP-IDF Python exception). If either is absent
the generator returns nothing and the site builds without these pages (they appear
in CI, where both are provisioned); a contributor without doxygen still gets the rest.
