"""Build (or serve) the projectMM docs site with MkDocs Material.

Phase 0 of the docs overhaul (docs/backlog/docs-system-overhaul.md): render the
existing docs/ tree as a navigable site, config in mkdocs.yml. Dependencies are
declared inline (PEP 723) so `uv run` provisions them — same pattern as the other
moondeck/docs/ tools and the uv-everywhere project rule; no requirements file.

Strict by default in CI: a broken link or a dead anchor fails the build. Out-of-tree source
links (../src/*.h, ../CLAUDE.md) are rewritten to GitHub URLs by mkdocs_hooks.py before
MkDocs sees them, so they raise no warning. A restructure once moved 170 files and left 153
dangling anchors that only a strict build surfaced; that is the failure this flag exists for.

The docs preview serves on :8422 (mkdocs' own default is :8000; we override it).
The three local dev servers use adjacent ports — MoonDeck :8420, installer
preview :8421, docs preview :8422 — so all three run at once without a port
clash. Override with --port.

Usage:
    uv run moondeck/docs/build_docs.py            # build to site/
    uv run moondeck/docs/build_docs.py --serve     # live-preview at :8422
    uv run moondeck/docs/build_docs.py --serve --port 9000   # serve on a custom port
    uv run moondeck/docs/build_docs.py --strict   # fail on any warning (the CI gate)

    (MoonDeck button or terminal). Only serve leaks a process — a plain
