"""Shared observation update for observed.<target> blocks: a rolling sample window
plus the statistics derived from it.

Both runners (moondeck/scenario/run_scenario.py and run_live_scenario.py) persist
per-target measurements for each scalar in the observed block.

WHY NOT [min, max]. The previous shape was a widen-only range, and widen-only is the
flaw: nothing ever narrows it, so the max converges on the worst thing that ever
happened on any machine rather than on what the code costs. One contended run pushed a
step from 156 to 2131 us permanently (2026-08-28, a desktop build streaming while the
scenarios measured). A number that only ever grows is not a signal, and comparing
against it hides the regressions it exists to catch.

WHY NOT mean and standard deviation. Tick times are not normally distributed: there is
a hard floor (the real work) and a one-sided tail of excursions (scheduler, cache,
contention), which is roughly log-normal. The mean is dragged by that tail, so it moves
when the machine is busy rather than when the code changes, and "outside 1 or 2 sigma"
has no stable meaning on a skewed distribution -- 2 sigma is ~5% of samples only if the
data is normal, and this data is not.

SO: keep a bounded window of raw samples and derive order statistics from it.
  - p50 (median): what it normally costs. Outliers cannot drag it.
  - p95: the tail, replacing max as the regression indicator. A real regression moves
    it; a single bad run does not.
  - min: the floor, i.e. the uncontended cost, which is genuinely informative.
  - max: kept for continuity with the previous shape and as an outlier tell.
  - n: how many samples back the numbers. n=1 is a first impression, not a baseline,
    and the reader can see which they are looking at.

Shape:
    observed.<target> = {
        "tick_us":         {"p50":…, "p95":…, "min":…, "max":…, "n":…, "samples":[…]},
        "free_heap":       {…},
        "max_alloc_block": {…},
        "last_updated":    iso_date,
    }

`last_updated` is the date this block last took a sample. It was `at` holding
`[first_seen, last_updated]`; the pair was dropped as misleading. After kWindow runs the
block's creation date describes samples that have long aged out, so it answered "when did
we start watching this" while reading as "how old is this data". The question a reader
actually has is whether the numbers are fresh, which one date answers.

The window is bounded (kWindow) so the file cannot grow without limit and so an old
contended sample eventually ages out, which the widen-only shape could never do.

The "what to watch" mapping is a property of the contract direction (tick contract =
ceiling, so p95 is the failure indicator; heap/block contract = floor, so min is).
See docs/testing.md § Persistent observations.

A target that cannot be run here (another OS) is reformatted into this shape with n=0
and an empty window, so the file is uniform and the absence of data is explicit rather
than implied by a stale pair of numbers.

# 0 is never a measurement, in any field, so it never enters a window.

# A tick of 0 us means the step ran below the host clock's resolution, not that it was free; a
# window holding those reports a median of 0, a step that looks infinitely fast. A free_heap or
# max_alloc_block of 0 is the desktop platform saying "no meaningful ceiling", which is a
# CONSTANT: the value never varies (verified across every scenario file: desktop has exactly one
# distinct value, 0), so a 32-sample window of it is 32 copies of a fact that could not change.
# Recording nothing leaves n=0, which the report already renders as "not measured here" -- the
# honest answer for a target that has no such limit. Every ESP32 target reports real varying
# numbers and is untouched by this.

# Samples kept per field. Enough for a p95 to mean something (the 95th percentile of 32
# samples is the second-worst, which a one-off cannot reach), small enough that the JSON
# stays readable and a stale measurement ages out within a few dozen runs.
