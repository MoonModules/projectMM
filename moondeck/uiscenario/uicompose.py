"""Cut published clips into one video, on the beat, with a music track.

A PROJECT file (test/uiscenarios/projects/<name>.json) is the edit: which clips, in what order,
how long each gets, and what plays underneath. It is the video editor's save file,
kept as JSON so a cut is reviewable and re-runnable rather than a sequence of manual
drags nobody can reproduce.

ffmpeg's concat demuxer does the joining, which is its standard mechanism for exactly
this: a listing of `file '...'` lines, no re-encode per clip beyond the normalization
pass every source needs to share a timebase. There is no richer project format inside
ffmpeg (EDL and OTIO belong to other tools), so the JSON generates the listing.

Timing is in BARS, not seconds. A cut lands on the music or it does not, and a bar is
the unit that makes that true: `bars: 8` at 112.35 BPM is 17.1 seconds, and changing
the track changes every duration correctly with one number.
