"""Drive the projectMM UI from a run file: one engine, for tests and for video.

Every step goes through the INTERFACE. A step that POSTs its way to the outcome
proves nothing about the UI and, on camera, shows an effect with no visible cause:
a value moving with the pointer parked beside it. The + tab, the type picker, the
card's own buttons and the control inputs are the only ways in.

REST is READ-ONLY here, and it is how a step checks itself: do the thing by hand,
then ask the device what it now holds. That is what lets one run file serve twice.
As a test the check is the assertion; as a video the same step carries a caption and
a duration, and the check is what keeps a silently broken take out of the cut.

Locators follow Playwright's own hierarchy. The UI carries no `data-testid`, but
`data-module`, `data-mid` and `data-tab-mid` are a real contract rather than styling
hooks: app.js queries ITSELF through them (updateModuleControls), so they cannot
drift without breaking the app. set_test_id_attribute points get_by_test_id at them,
which puts every lookup in the sanctioned test-id tier instead of raw CSS. Roles are
not usable here: the buttons carry `title`, which contributes no accessible name.

The mechanism lives here; the content lives in a run file. See moondeck/uiscenario/RUNS.md.
