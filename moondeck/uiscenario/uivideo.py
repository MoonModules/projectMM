"""Record a run file as video, with its captions and cursor.

Same engine and same run file as the UI tests: the steps are the steps, and this
caller adds a camera. Playwright's own Screencast API draws the cursor, highlights
what each action touches and renders the captions as overlays, so there is no second
pass burning text into frames and no hand-drawn pointer to keep in sync.

Prerequisites:
    1. A running projectMM:   uv run moondeck/run/run_desktop.py
    2. Playwright's chromium: uv run --with playwright playwright install chromium

    Speed and scale each take about a third off and they multiply; the CODEC barely
    matters (VP9 crf30 saved 10%), because a 3D preview is constantly-changing pixels
    rather than a static page. 960 keeps every label and control value legible.

    Speeding up is honest here: it changes the VIDEO, not what the run did, so the
    test and the clip still describe the same interaction. A UI demo at recording
