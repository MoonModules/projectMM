"""Lay a spoken track over a recorded clip, one line per caption.

A clip already says what it is showing, in its captions. This speaks them, so the clip can be
watched rather than read. The words are the captions themselves: a second script would drift from
what is on screen the first time either is edited.

Timing comes from the run file rather than from guesswork. Each caption is held for a known number
of seconds, so a line starts when its caption appears and the silence between lines is the rest of
that shot. A line longer than its hold is reported rather than overlapped, because the fix belongs
in the run file (hold the shot longer) and not in the mix.

Piper speaks the lines, the same neural voice `uinarrate` gives Luna, so a clip and the
introduction sound like one person rather than two.

Usage:
  uv run moondeck/uiscenario/uivoiceover.py --run test/uiscenarios/clips/05-layouts.json \\
      [--voice Serena] [--clip docs/assets/uiscenarios/05-layouts.webm]
