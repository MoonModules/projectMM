"""Put a device back in the state a fresh boot leaves it in, over REST.

A clip must not open on the previous take's ending. Doing that reset INSIDE a run file costs screen
time the clip is not about and shows the tidying rather than the subject, so it happens here, before
the camera rolls, and every run file starts on the same picture.

The target is what `src/main.cpp` wires at boot: Layouts holds one GridLayout at its default size,
Effects holds one Layer running PulseEffect, and Drivers holds the two modules the boot path adds
(LightPresetsModule and PreviewDriver) and nothing else.
