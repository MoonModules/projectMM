    This is the answer to "which code is on this board?" — the question MM_BUILD_DATE
    cannot answer. `__DATE__`/`__TIME__` expand when the *including translation unit*
    compiles, and build_info.h is a header consumed by one TU: change a driver .cpp and
    that TU is NOT rebuilt, so the reported date FREEZES while the firmware moves on. A
    stale date reads as "the flash didn't take" and sends you debugging the wrong binary
    (measured the hard way, 2026-07-16). The hash comes from git at generate time and is
    regenerated on every build (the CMake rule is ALWAYS out-of-date by design), so it
    tracks the source, not a compile timestamp.

    Falls back to "nogit" for a tarball / no-git build — never fails the build.

/// @defgroup build_info Compile-time identity

/// Every fact about which binary this is, as the build system knew it.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// This header is generated from `library.json` by `moondeck/build/generate_build_info.py`, so an edit belongs in that script rather than here.
///
/// ## What each macro answers
///
/// | Macro | What it names |
/// |-------|---------------|
/// | `MM_VERSION` | the semver, defaulting to `library.json` and overridden by the release pipeline through `compute_version.py` |
/// | `MM_BUILD_DATE` | roughly when the including translation unit was compiled, for a human to read |
/// | `MM_BUILD_ID` | the short git hash the binary was built from, suffixed with `+` when the tree was dirty, or `nogit` without a checkout |
/// | `MM_FIRMWARE_NAME` | the compiled-binary variant, such as `esp32-eth` or `esp32s3-n16r8` |
/// | `MM_RELEASE` | the release channel the binary shipped on, such as `latest` or `v1.0.0` |
///
/// Each carries an `#ifndef` default, so a local build needs no flag.
/// A release `MM_VERSION` is the core semver for a stable tag, or `<core>-dev.<N>` for a moving `latest` build so successive builds are orderable.
///
/// ## Why the build id is the identity, not the date
///
/// `__DATE__` and `__TIME__` expand when the including translation unit compiles, and only that unit's own dependencies trigger a rebuild.
/// Edit a driver `.cpp` and the date does not move, so a freshly flashed board still reports the old timestamp.
/// Two different builds can also carry the same date.
/// A stale date reads as a flash that did not take and sends you debugging the wrong binary.
///
/// The build id comes from git at generate time and is regenerated on every build, the CMake rule being always out of date by design.
/// It therefore names the source rather than a compile moment.
/// Read it off a running device to answer what landed, which has to be answerable before any bench measurement can be trusted.
///
/// ## Firmware against board, and version against release
///
/// A firmware is the compiled-binary variant; the physical board is a separate concept the device cannot identify on its own, which the architecture page covers.
/// `build_esp32.py` passes the firmware name through `firmware_cmake_args`, and `package_desktop.py` does the same for a release desktop build.
/// A local CMake build falls through to `unknown`, since it is never published.
///
/// `MM_VERSION` says what code this is and `MM_RELEASE` says which channel it shipped on.
/// A moving `latest` build and a tagged release can share a semver and differ in channel.
/// A local build has no channel at all, so SystemModule then shows the bare semver.
