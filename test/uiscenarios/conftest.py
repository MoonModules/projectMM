"""Fixtures for the UI tests: a browser pointed at a running projectMM.

These are the only tests that need a device. Everything in test/python is pure and
runs anywhere; a UI test drives a real interface against real firmware, so it SKIPS
rather than fails when nothing is listening. That is the same shape the JS lane uses
for a missing node: a bench without a running desktop build is a normal setup, and
"this does not apply here" is what skip means.
