// MoonLedDriver is the SAME LCD_CAM output as MultiPinLedDriver, on our own DMA code instead of
// esp_lcd. It is a thin ParallelLedDriver subclass whose constructor wires a
// MoonI80Peripheral backend (a runtime LedPeripheral strategy, not compile-time CRTP), so the
// orchestrator's whole body — lane slicing, frame sizing, the fused encode, the async double-buffer,
// the shift-register expander, the dead-frame guard — is ALREADY covered by the Mock-driver suites
// (unit_ParallelLedDriver_doublebuffer / _shiftregister) and by unit_I80LedDriver. Re-testing it
// here through a second concrete driver would assert the same base twice.
//
// So these cases pin only what is genuinely MoonI80's own:
//   - it satisfies the LedPeripheral contract (it instantiates and configures at all);
//   - the constants that DIFFER from its sibling — chiefly that it is LCD_CAM-only;
//   - its own bus-pin validation, and the fact that it needs FEWER pins than the sibling: no DC at
//     all, and WR only under the expander (owning the GPIO matrix is what buys that).
//
// The hardware half (our GDMA descriptor chain) is inert on the host — desktop stubs return
// false/nullptr and `lanesAvailable()` is 0 — and is proven on the S3 bench.

namespace {

// On the host `platform::lcdLanes` is 0, so the real MoonI80Peripheral reports supportsPinExpander()
// == false — which the orchestrator now honors by SILENTLY dropping pinExpander back to direct mode
// (a peripheral that can't host the '595 has its expander toggle hidden, so an unfixable error would be
// wrong — see parseConfig). That degradation is correct on hardware but hides the SHIFT-MODE validation
// (WR collision, latch-on-WR, clockPin required) these cases exist to pin. So the shift-mode cases use
// this tiny subclass that reports the expander as supported, exactly as the real backend does on an
// LCD_CAM chip — the validation then runs on the host.

// **The load-bearing difference from its sibling.** MultiPinLedDriver runs on the i80 *bus* — LCD_CAM on

// programs LCD_CAM directly, so it must NOT claim the classic chip: `lanesAvailable()` reads
// `lcdLanes` alone, without the `+ i2sLanes` its sibling adds. Getting this wrong would offer the
