// The DRIVER half of the 74HCT595 shift-register expander (unit_ParallelSlots pins the encoded
// bits). What matters here is the arithmetic the user's memory budget depends on, and the config
// guards that stop a mis-wired board from emitting a waveform the hardware can't sustain:
//
//   - lanes = pins x 8 (each data pin fans out to 8 strands through its '595)
//   - the DMA frame grows x8 (a '595 is serial-in: presenting a slot costs 8 shift cycles)
//   - but extra STRANDS are free (they ride the bus width), so 15x256 and 48x256 cost the SAME
//   - the bus stays 8-bit: 48 strands on 6 pins is not a 16-bit bus
//   - the latch is a bus lane, so it must not collide with a data pin

// LAYOUT (bus-word indices) rather than OBSERVABLE BEHAVIOUR. These pin the behaviour.
//
// The bug: with the ×8 expander the DMA frame is 8× bigger (154 KB), so a transfer takes ~4.6 ms on
// the wire instead of ~0.6 ms. esp_lcd's GDMA link list is mounted from index 0 and only counts
// descriptors the PREVIOUS transfer has released, so the next frame's mount landed mid-transfer and
// failed (`lli full`). Critically the failure was SILENT: tx_color returns ESP_OK (the enqueue
// succeeded; the mount fails later in the ISR), so the driver believed the transfer had started,
// waited for a done-callback that never came, and burned a 1 s timeout every frame.
//
// The observable symptoms — and what each test below pins:
//   1. a transfer that never completes must not wedge the driver (it must keep ticking, degraded);
//   2. it must never re-encode into a buffer the DMA may still be reading (frame corruption);
//   3. the driver must not silently treat "enqueued" as "delivered".

// A transfer that NEVER completes (the done-callback never fires) must not wedge the driver. On the
