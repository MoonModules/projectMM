// @module EffectBase

// The grid-size floor, swept across EVERY registered effect rather than one at a time.
//
// The hard rule (CLAUDE.md § Principles, Robustness; architecture.md § Robustness rules):
// an effect must produce a correct result at ANY grid size, including a degenerate one —
// no crash, no divide-by-zero, no out-of-bounds write. A modifier can shrink the logical
// grid to 0x0x0 (every layout child disabled), and a 1-wide or 1-deep grid is what a
// single strand or a flat panel actually is.
//
// Layer::tick owns the degenerate-grid gate: it skips the effect pass when any axis is 0,
// so effects may assume width/height/depth >= 1 and carry no such guard themselves. The
// 0x0x0 row therefore pins the LAYER's behaviour, not each effect's: that a folded-away
// grid produces a clean no-op and a zero-byte buffer rather than a crash. Effect bodies
// are covered by the three non-degenerate rows, where they do run.
//
// Do NOT "improve" this by calling fx->tick() directly on the zero grid. That asserts a
// contract no effect makes, and it fails: GEQ3DEffect divides by width() (imap over a
// zero range) and takes SIGFPE. The single Layer gate is what makes that safe.
//
// Per-effect tests pin this one effect at a time, which means a NEW effect is covered only
// if its author remembers to write that case. This sweep asks the factory for every
// registered effect instead, so the floor is enforced for effects that do not exist yet:
// register an effect, and it is swept the moment it lands.
//
// Reading a failure: the CHECK message names the effect and the grid it died on. "Died"
// here means it crashed the runner — an effect that draws nothing on a zero grid is
// correct (a clean no-op is the specified behaviour), so the assertion is about surviving
// and leaving a well-formed buffer, not about pixels.
