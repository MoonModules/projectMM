"""check_docgen.py guards the generated documentation, so this guards it back.

The rules it enforces (documentation-standards.md § The card) are invisible when they
break: a regex that stops matching makes the check print a clean run, which is
indistinguishable from a tree with nothing wrong in it. Four `## HLS, details` headings
lived in the tree unlinked for exactly that reason, found by adding the rule rather than
by the rule working.

So each rule is pinned twice: it FIRES on a page written to break it, and it stays SILENT
on a page that obeys. A test that only asserted the silence would pass against a check
that had stopped reading anything at all.
