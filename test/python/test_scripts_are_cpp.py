"""Every shipped MoonLive script is valid C++.

MoonLive is documented as a subset of C++, and that claim is worth more than a description: it is
what lets someone read a script without learning a language, and what keeps the grammar from
drifting into a dialect one feature at a time. A claim nothing checks is a claim that decays.

So each script is wrapped in a generated prelude and handed to a real C++ compiler. The prelude
declares the vocabulary (the builtins, the system variables, the type aliases) and nothing else:
the SCRIPT's own text is compiled unmodified except for the one shape difference the language
deliberately has, applied mechanically here and listed in the language reference:

  - a class needs `public:` and a trailing semicolon in C++

Anything else a compiler rejects is a real divergence, and this test is where it surfaces.

The prelude is GENERATED from the engine's own builtin table rather than hand-written, so a builtin
added to the language cannot leave this test asserting against a stale vocabulary. Signatures are
`int` throughout: this is a syntax check (`-fsyntax-only`), never a run, so the shapes that matter
are the arity and the name.

Skips when no C++ compiler is on PATH, which is the case in a bare CI container. Run:
`uv run --with pytest pytest test/python/test_scripts_are_cpp.py -q`.
