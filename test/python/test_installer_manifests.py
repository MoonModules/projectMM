"""The web installer's per-release files must all be generatable and self-consistent.

The installer fetches, per release, one ESP Web Tools manifest per *shipping* firmware
(`/install/releases/<tag>/manifest-<firmware>.json`), and each manifest names the `.bin`
parts to flash. Those parts MUST be files the release workflow actually stages onto Pages —
the staging step (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) downloads them with these globs:

    firmware-*.bin   shared-ota-data.bin   partition-table-*.bin

A manifest that references a filename outside those globs points at a file that never reaches
Pages → the installer 404s at fetch-firmware. That exact mismatch (a manifest referencing a
file the deploy didn't stage, or a shipping firmware with no manifest at all) shipped a broken
v2.0.0 installer; this test pins the contract so it can't recur:

  1. every `ships: true` firmware in docs/install/firmwares.json generates a valid manifest, and
  2. every part path in every manifest matches one of the staged-file globs above.

Self-contained: it feeds generate_manifest.py a synthetic flasher_args.json (the real one only
exists after an ESP-IDF build), so it runs in plain CI with no firmware build.
