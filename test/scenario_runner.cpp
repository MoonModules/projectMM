/// Scenario runner: reads scenario JSON files and replays their steps in-process.
///
/// The same JSON files run against a live system through `moondeck/scenario/run_live_scenario.py`, so one scenario serves both tiers.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## Why the parser decodes escapes
///
/// Appending the character after a backslash raw turned `\n` into a literal `n`, so a multi-line string arrived as one line.
/// The failure was invisible until `write_file` staged a script and the compiler reported "expected '(' after the function name" on a file that looked correct in the JSON.
/// So every escape the parser accepts is decoded to the byte it names.
///
/// ## Why a uXXXX escape warns instead of decoding
///
/// No scenario needs one, and a half-done UTF-16 surrogate decoder would be worse than not having one.
/// It must not pass through silently either. Appending a literal `u` stages a script containing `u00e9`, and the failure then surfaces as a confusing compile error in a file that looks right in the JSON.
/// So the runner says so, loudly, once, and keeps the escape visible rather than half-decoding it.
///
/// ## Why the target key is always the host desktop
///
/// The per-step `expected[<target>]` lookup needs a target key, and the in-process runner builds for the host only.
/// There is no cross-compiled scenario_runner, so the key is always `desktop-<host-os>`, matching the `run_live_scenario.py` convention.
///
/// ## How a scenario value reaches a control
///
/// A `set_control` step finds the module by id and the control by name, writes the typed value, then mirrors `HttpServerModule::handleSetControl`.
/// That means calling `onControlChanged()` and, when `affectsPrepare()` returns true, triggering `Scheduler::prepareTree()` so the pipeline reconciles.
/// The bridge runs JsonVal through raw JSON text into `mm::applyControlValue`, so this file hand-rolls none of the per-ControlType dispatch that Control.cpp owns.
/// A tiny `{"v":VALUE}` wrapper built with JsonSink in heap-grow mode carries it, since writeNumber, writeBool and writeJsonString each produce JSON-correct text per JsonVal type.
/// Re-serialize-then-parse costs nothing worth counting in test code, at most a hundred set_control ops per scenario.
/// Strict policy: an out-of-range Uint8, Int16 or Select fails the step, so a scenario-authoring bug surfaces instead of silently clamping into a boundary value.
/// This is stricter than the pre-refactor behavior for Uint8 and Int16, which clamped silently, and matches it for Select and IPv4, which already failed; no scenario relied on the clamp.
///
/// ## Why a delete purges the whole subtree
///
/// Deleting a module that has registered children, a Layer with an effect child say, would leave their ids pointing at freed memory.
/// So every `modules` entry whose pointer lies in the root's subtree is erased first, root and all descendants, which means walking the live tree while the subtree is still intact.
/// `purgeSubtree` runs before `deleteTree`, and `replace_module` and `clear_children` mirror it for the same reason.
///
/// ## Why fixtures wire props at construct time
///
/// The fixture phase runs before the scheduler starts, so `set_control` cannot apply grid dimensions yet.
/// Without a construct-time apply, `props.width` and `props.height` were silently ignored and the grid stayed at the layout's default, masking the real scenario size.
/// GridBlacksLayout takes the same apply; its dark-column controls blackStart and blackCount are set later through `set_control`, which works post-start.
/// Effects gets the container's Layouts, mirroring main.cpp's `effectsContainer->setLayouts`, and re-propagates it to every child Effects at each prepareTree, so a Layer added later picks it up.
/// Drivers prefers binding the Effects container, since the active Layer is re-resolved at every prepareTree. So a Layer cleared and rebuilt mid-scenario is picked up, and pinning one Layer is the fallback for older fixtures.
/// PreviewDriver needs no scenario-specific wiring: it reads its Layer and sparse source buffer through Drivers' passBufferToDrivers, and owns its own scratch buffers.
/// No broadcaster is wired, the harness has no WS server, so sendFrame and sendCoordTable early-return on the null broadcaster while the light-extraction work still runs for honest tick measurement.
///
/// ## Why skip_on exists
///
/// A scenario-level `skip_on` allowlist names host targets that lack a capability the scenario exercises.
/// Today that is the MoonLive scenarios opting out on desktop-windows and desktop-linux, because the desktop JIT is arm64-only. An x86_64 host renders dark, so the scenario's "buffer non-zero" check fails for a platform-capability reason it is the wrong vehicle to assert.
/// An absent or empty `skip_on` runs everywhere, the existing default.
/// It is the field `run_scenario.py` honours, and keeping the C++ runner in step stops KPI collection, which calls mm_scenarios directly, from counting a skipped scenario as a failure.
///
/// ## The construct and mutate modes
///
/// The `mode` field says what shape the scenario expects the world to be in; see docs/reference/testing.md § Scenario modes.
/// A construct scenario builds the pipeline from an empty scheduler and runs in-process only. A live device's main.cpp owns the top-level shape, and only the in-process runner can provide an empty scheduler.
/// A mutate scenario assumes a wired pipeline. In-process replays the embedded `fixture` array first, an array of add_module steps in the same shape as `steps`, then the steps. Live runs the steps directly against whatever is wired.
/// A mutate scenario without a fixture can still run live, the device being its own fixture, but cannot run in-process.
/// The default is construct, for back-compatibility with the scenarios that pre-date the field and build their pipelines explicitly.
/// Bespoke convention: the construct and mutate split, plus fixture and reset, is projectMM-specific rather than borrowed from an off-the-shelf BDD framework.
/// It exists because the same JSON serves an in-process runner that owns the scheduler and a live runner that does not, main.cpp doing that there.
/// xUnit fixtures are the closest analog for `fixture`, and SQL BEGIN/ROLLBACK for `reset`.
///
/// ## The fixture, reset and steps sections
///
/// Three sections run in order, each with its own banner so the output is easy to scan.
/// Fixture carries add_module steps, in-process only, and builds the wired pipeline.
/// Reset carries set_control steps to a known state, runs on both tiers, and makes a scenario start from the same place regardless of previous runs.
/// Steps is the scenario proper.
///
/// ## Why the scheduler starts lazily
///
/// Steps are processed in order, and the first measure step, or the end of the scenario, flips the scheduler into setup and running mode.
/// After that a mid-scenario add_module or set_control step mutates the running pipeline, the same shape as the live runner driving changes over REST.
/// A mid-scenario add therefore also calls defineControls, setup and prepareTree at once, mirroring what HttpServerModule does on `/api/modules`.
/// Starting after the fixture is what makes set_control work at all, since controls are populated in defineControls during setup.
/// Per-step heap snapshots roll forward, so each measuring step reports its delta against the previous one.
///
/// ## Why an unknown module type fails
///
/// A failed create is a failed scenario: naming an unregistered type would otherwise pass while testing nothing.
/// The `optional` flag is for a type genuinely unavailable here, and it is honoured on add_module, set_control, measure, remove_module and delete_module and nowhere else.
/// Carrying it elsewhere reads as an escape hatch that does not exist, so the runner fails such a step rather than accepting the word.
///
/// ## Why write_file exists
///
/// It stages a file the way the UI's editor does, so a scenario can drive the script loop end-to-end. Write a script, point a module's `script` control at it, and measure.
/// It uses the primitive the HTTP save path uses, fsWriteAtomic, so a scenario exercises the file the device would actually read. It also mkdir -p's the parent, because a scenario names `/moonlive/x.mle` without staging the directory.
/// The interesting cases have no shipped file to select. A deliberately broken script, proving the device degrades rather than dies, could not live in moonlive/, where unit_MoonLiveScripts compiles all of them.
/// Neither could an edit that changes a script's control set, proving controls re-derive and keep their values.
/// A malformed step and a failed write are both failed scenarios. Every later step then runs against a file that was never staged, and the run could still report PASSED.
/// Skipping either silently is what makes a typo'd key pass here and fail on hardware, where `run_live_scenario.py` already treats it as an error.
///
/// ## Why remove_module and delete_module are aliases
///
/// Both are accepted so a scenario reads identically here and on the live runner, which uses `delete_module`.
/// The two runners must never diverge on op names, or a scenario silently no-ops on one tier.
/// The op removes a child from its parent, mirroring `HttpServerModule::handleDeleteModule`: remove from parent, release, recursive delete, rebuild pipeline state.
/// Only child modules can be removed, top-level modules being policy-fixed, and a non-editable submodule such as Board, Preview or Improv is apparatus rather than content.
/// `replace_module` mirrors `handleReplaceModule` under the same rules, and re-registers the fresh module under the same scenario id so later steps still address it by that id.
///
/// ## Why clear_children exists
///
/// It is the "prepare my own canvas" primitive: a scenario assumes nothing about the device's starting tree, clears a container, then adds what it needs.
/// Children are deleted including ones the scenario never added, such as a live device's pre-existing effects and modifiers, leaving the container itself.
/// It mirrors remove_module's release looped over all children, walking back-to-front since removeChild compacts the array in place, and skipping the non-editable submodules the live device also keeps.
///
/// ## Why a measure step has two spellings
///
/// `"measure": true` is the explicit flag, used alongside a set_control to measure after a mutation.
/// `op: "measure"` is the implicit-measure shape, a snapshot step with no other side effects, so scenarios can interleave snapshots without faking a control write.
/// The measurement block honours both.
/// A `bounds.fps.min_pct` is relative to a live baseline, used by the WiFi-versus-Eth scenarios, and only the live runner has a baseline to compare against.
/// In-process cannot enforce it, so it logs a clear skip and users see why the bound was not applied instead of it silently becoming "FPS > 0".
///
/// ## What the heap numbers mean
///
/// `heap=` is the absolute free heap after the measurement window, which is what `observed.<target>.free_heap` consumes: the rolling promise is on actual free heap rather than on a delta.
/// On desktop `freeHeap()` returns 0, meaning unlimited, and the value renders as 0, which the runner treats as "no heap assertion".
/// `(step: ±N)` is the signed step delta from the pre-step heap to the post-measurement heap, useful for diagnosing which step consumed memory but not what the contract asserts on.
/// It is kept for human-readable diagnostics.
/// A heap-delta bound fails a step that grew the heap by more than `max_delta_bytes` against the previous measurement, which catches a leak or an unintended alloc.
///
/// ## Why the block size is internal RAM only
///
/// `maxInternalAllocBlock` reports the largest contiguous block in internal RAM, which diagnoses internal-heap fragmentation.
/// Fragmentation silently degrades the Layer LUT, whose buffer needs 60 to 90 KB contiguous at 128×128 with mirror, and dropping mirror does not change free_heap.
/// The internal-only variant is what makes the signal work on PSRAM boards too, where `maxAllocBlock` would report about 8 MB regardless of internal pressure.
/// On desktop it reads 0, meaning unlimited.
///
/// ## The performance contract
///
/// Each measure step may carry a `contract[<target>]` block with `tick_us` and `free_heap`, optional `tick_tolerance_pct`, `heap_tolerance_pct` and `tolerance_us`, and `set_by` plus `reason` describing when and why the contract was set.
/// Contracts are hand-blessed promises, renegotiated with `--update-contract --reason`; the whole block is optional, and the live runner shares this shape so the same scenarios serve both tiers.
/// `tick_us` is a ceiling, so faster than contract is good news and the tolerance absorbs upward jitter only: a speedup never fails.
/// `free_heap` is a floor, meaningful on ESP32 and reported as unlimited on desktop. The device must deliver at least this much, more is fine, and less by more than the tolerance is a regression.
/// `max_alloc_block` is a floor too, because the LUT and driver buffers need a single contiguous chunk far larger than total free heap once fragmentation kicks in.
/// A scenario opts into that assertion when its workload depends on a specific minimum, the mirror LUT degrading silently when the block will not fit; see `src/light/layers/Layer.h` Layer::rebuildLUT.
/// The field is optional and skipped on desktop, where the value is always 0.
///
/// ## Why the tolerance defaults differ per target
///
/// The per-target defaults reflect run-to-run variance rather than indifference.
/// A desktop target carries multi-process OS jitter, so 20 percent plus a 200us absolute floor, and the floor dominates below about 1ms tick, the realistic case.
/// An esp32 target is a bounded RTOS with lwIP and EMAC jitter, so 10 percent plus a 5us floor, realistic for the bounded RTOS clock.
/// An absolute floor is needed because OS scheduling jitter dwarfs any percentage tolerance at sub-millisecond ticks.
/// KEEP IN SYNC: the live runner re-declares the same defaults in the contract-block handler of `moondeck/scenario/run_live_scenario.py`, and tuning one without the other silently desyncs the two tiers.
///
/// ## Why a filesystem error escapes main
///
/// Directory iteration can throw `filesystem_error`, a scenarios/ directory deleted mid-run being the case.
/// Letting it escape main is the correct outcome for a CLI test runner. It terminates with a diagnostic and a non-zero status, which is exactly what a harness needs to see.
/// Discovery is recursive so the core/ and light/ split picks up every JSON without each subfolder needing its own loop.
