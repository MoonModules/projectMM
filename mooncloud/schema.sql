-- One table. There is no address column and no precise timestamp, because neither is collected:
-- the country arrives already derived at the edge, and the date is stored to the DAY, since a
-- timestamp to the second plus a country is a fingerprint.

--
-- Every message is readable by everyone, so nothing here is private and the table holds only what a

-- id Stats uses, which makes messages from one device groupable without naming anyone.

-- SEPARATE from `reports` because the two answer different questions and cannot share a shape.
-- `reports` is CURRENT STATE: one row per installation per version, overwritten when a device
-- re-reports, so it answers "what is running now". This table is HISTORY: one row per report ever
-- received, never updated, so it answers "what happened in March".
--
-- It exists now rather than when someone wants a chart, because history cannot be reconstructed
-- afterwards: `reports` overwrites `receivedAt` on every conflict, so the moment a device
-- re-reports, when it first reported is gone. A table added in six months starts empty.
--
-- No installation id is stored here. A dated row per installation is a movement profile, and
-- nothing a trend asks needs one: "how many upgrades in March" counts rows.
