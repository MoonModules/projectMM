# LED signal integrity: flicker on LEDs that should be off

Random wrong colors on LEDs the effect leaves black, most often a few stray pixels flickering, is, on a 3.3 V ESP32 driving WS2812 **directly**, almost always a **data-line signal-integrity** problem, not a firmware bug. WS2812 wants a logic-high near 0.7 × VDD (≈ 3.5 V on a 5 V strip), but the ESP32 drives only 3.3 V, so individual bits sit at the margin and noise tips them.

Confirm the firmware is innocent **before** reaching for the soldering iron. These checks are the bench diagnosis path (recorded in [lessons.md](../work/past/lessons.md)):

1. **Is the data clean?** The preview/source buffer is the logical RGB the effect produced. If it shows no stray color, the effect is innocent (the corruption is downstream of the buffer).
2. **Is the firmware/peripheral clean?** Run the [`loopbackFrame` self-test](../moonmodules/light/drivers.md#led-drivers) through a short jumper on the data pin. A `PASS` means the RMT encode + transmit emit bit-perfect WS2812, so the GPIO is fine.
3. **Is it WiFi RF?** Lower `Network.txPowerSetting` from 20 dBm down toward 2 and watch. If the flicker shrinks with TX power, it's radio coupling into the data wire (mitigate with the level shifter below). If it's **unchanged across the whole sweep, it is not the radio**: it is the physical data path.

When 1–3 all come back clean, the fix is electrical, in rough order of effectiveness:

- **Add a 3.3 → 5 V level shifter** on the data line (e.g. 74HCT125 / 74AHCT125), the single most effective fix; it restores the logic-high margin the LEDs expect.
- **Add a ~330 Ω series resistor** at the GPIO, close to the board, to damp reflections.
- **Shorten / shield the data wire**, and keep it away from the power leads and the antenna.
- **Share a solid, thick common ground** between the strip's supply and the board.
- If RF coupling was implicated by step 3, set a per-board `Network.txPowerSetting` cap (the same `deviceModels.json` mechanism the ESP32-S3 N16R8 Dev uses).
