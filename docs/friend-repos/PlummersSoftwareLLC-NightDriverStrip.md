# NightDriverStrip — monthly activity digest

What landed on [NightDriverStrip](https://github.com/PlummersSoftwareLLC/NightDriverStrip)'s `main` branch, month by month. External-context reference — a factual log of a friend repo's releases, not projectMM's own history or roadmap. Newest month on top. The reusable prompt that generates these lives in [README.md](README.md).

Summarised via the GitHub commits API (no local clone), so counts are all commits on `main`, not first-parent merges — the bullets filter out dependency bumps, whitespace, and pure refactors. Releases are noted as context rather than used as month boundaries: **v1.3.0** (published 2026-01-10) was tagged from a late-November commit, and the latest are **v2.0.0** and **v2.0.1**, both published 2026-06-14. v1.3.0 is not a clean month boundary so its month is kept whole; June IS split at v2.0.0, which was cut from `main` mid-month (see the two June sections below).

## August 2026

- **M5Stack Tab5 support**, a new build target for the Tab5's 1280x720 DSI display. Effects render into a logical canvas that the backend then scales up by a whole-number factor onto the panel, so the existing effect library runs on a screen far larger than the 64x32 matrix it was written for.
- **Effects redrawn for high resolution.** Many patterns had never had to draw outside a 64x32 box. Animated GIF, Circuit, Life, Pong Clock, Radar, Smoke, Stocks, Swirl, Wave and the spectrum analyzer now size themselves to the matrix: the Stocks ticker picks a larger font on wide displays, and GIF/JPEG playback keeps the image's aspect ratio and centers it instead of stretching to fill.
- **Faster blur on large panels.** Blur walks row-major framebuffers directly, which matters once a frame is millions of pixels rather than a couple of thousand.
- **A new "Mesmerizer Tab" build** joins the existing Mesmerizer environments.
- **Fixed: WiFi kept reconnecting when it was already connected.** The reconnect timer now checks whether the station is already associated before starting another attempt.
- **Fixed: a WiFi crash on the Tab5.** Reading the IP, gateway and DNS from inside the connect callback could trip an assertion on the Tab5's hosted WiFi chip; the log line is now shorter and safe.
- **Breaking, for builders: the ESP32 toolchain is now pinned to pioarduino 55.03.37** for every environment, replacing the earlier mix of official PlatformIO and pioarduino platforms. This is the first release that works with Python 3.14 on macOS and Linux, so you no longer have to downgrade Python or edit VS Code settings to build. Platforms are now fetched into the project folder rather than a global cache.
- **Partition tables updated** (standard, 8 MB, Feather and no-OTA) to meet the new toolchain's minimum settings-storage size. Re-flashing may be needed rather than an over-the-air update.
- Note for TTGO T-Display builders: an unused display library dependency was dropped from that environment.

No versioned release in August; the most recent is v2.0.1 from June 2026.

## July 2026

A quiet month: one feature merge, no release, no issues.

- **Mesmerizer matrix panels switched to the HUB75-DMA backend** (replacing SmartMatrix), so the LED-matrix output path is now shared across all Mesmerizer boards.
- Two new supported boards: **ESP32-DevKitC V4** (local effects only, no PSRAM) and **ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 N16R8** (16 MB flash, 8 MB PSRAM, USB serial logging). On both, the BOOT button steps through effects.
- The startup splash screen now renders immediately instead of waiting for WiFi.
- Better behaviour on low-memory boards: the firmware degrades gracefully instead of failing when memory runs short.
- Fixed the JPEG decoder not being ready in time for the startup splash, and corrected serial status output on S3 boards.

_Auditability: 3 commits on `main` author-dated 2026-07-01..2026-07-31 (1 first-parent merge — PR #901, merged July 18 — plus a whitespace commit); `commits?sha=main&since=…&until=…`. Issues checked via `search/issues` for `created:2026-07-01..2026-07-31` (0), `closed:` (0) and `updated:` (0) in the same range. No versioned release published in July (latest are v2.0.0/v2.0.1, both June 14), so the month is kept whole._

## June 2026 (up to v2.0.0)

The big one: **NightDriverStrip 2.0.0** shipped on June 14 — a major release cut from `main`.

**New**
- Brand-new Web UI replacing the old one, plus a new browser-based web installer for flashing devices.
- Runtime-selectable output drivers: settings that used to be compile-time (like strip type) can now be changed on the device without rebuilding.
- APA102 / SK9822 strips are now a first-class output type alongside WS281x and HUB75.
- Multi-layered, categorized device settings structure.
- New optional WiFi-activity output pin that goes HIGH while WiFi is drawing; projects can now define zero active effects and stay idle until then.
- Effect-timeout reset on a remote-control effect switch is now a user setting (previous always-reset behavior stays the default).
- Effects reworked (weather, stocks, subscribers, etc.) to display usefully on short 48x16 matrices.
- New and revised effects, plus smarter memory handling (targeted mix of internal RAM and PSRAM).

**Fixed**
- Render hiccup/stutter when settings auto-saved: SPIFFS/JSON writes no longer block the render thread.
- Effect-manager crash shortly after load when the effect set changed.
- Serpentine-matrix visualization corrected.
- Lower COLORDATA server framerate optimized for smoother remote color streaming.
- PSRAM-related instability during flash/cache writes reduced by keeping save-time JSON in internal RAM.

## June 2026 (post-v2.0.0)

- **v2.0.1** (also June 14): patch that fixes the web installer failing to build for the 2.0.0 release (removed a stale project entry).
- Stock-ticker effect now shows correct live data, fetched through the new V2 API.
- Fixed 64x32 (wide-and-short) displays that were rotating and doubling their content instead of scaling — effect previews in the Web UI and CLI now match the active output driver's pixel mapping (issue #878).

**Watching**
- Issue #877 ("networking seems broken") drew heavy discussion (38 comments) around the WebUI being unreachable after a recent merge on some setups; closed in June.

Auditability: ~40 first-parent merges/commits on `main` with author-date in 2026-06-01..2026-06-30 (`commits?sha=main&since=…until=…`); two versioned releases published June 14 — v2.0.0 (commit ce00eaa) and v2.0.1 (commit 835015b), both ancestors of `main`, so the month is split at v2.0.0. Issues checked via `search/issues` for `created:2026-06-01..2026-06-30` (0 opened in range) and `closed:2026-06-01..2026-06-30` (#877, #878, #825 closed; #878 and #877 user-facing).

## May 2026

*~75 commits on `main`, 2026-05-01 … 2026-05-31.*

**New**

- **RGBWW / SK6812 white-channel support** — W/WW helpers, a WarmGlow test effect, configurable SK6812 white extraction; color-temperature naming cleanup.
- **New Setup Wizard / guided-installer WebUI** — and a push to make the UI a "non-special consumer": everything the official UI needs now comes from the firmware over the wire (spec/schema), not baked into `app.js`.
- M5 Stick S3 support (IR + WS2812B); optimised WS2812B draw path; `ACTIVITY_PIN` support; allow zero effects in the table.

**Fixed / hardened**

- Major **PSRAM strategy reversal** — switched to PSRAM-default routing (threshold 96, Mesmerizer's proven value) and removed the bespoke `psram_allocator` family; JSON save-path now uses internal RAM to avoid touching PSRAM during flash/cache-disabled windows.
- Several concurrency and memory-safety fixes across buffer / drawing / network / task paths; PolarMap and noise-generation bugs; weather-data state protection.

## April 2026

*~60 commits on `main`, 2026-04-01 … 2026-04-30.*

**New**

- **New local WebUI** with a custom LED RMT output driver, dynamic settings, and a WS2812B output driver; first beat-detection / audio-architecture modernization pass.
- OTA: successfully cancels rollback on boot; unified hardware identity via eFuse.

**Fixed**

- LED-buffer crash (#842); socket race condition + NTP init issues; nullptr deref polling MAC before the C6 companion is ready; Cube/Noise matrix-effect refactors; PSRAM cache-issue partition correctness; hexagon build.

## March 2026

*~32 commits on `main`, 2026-03-01 … 2026-03-31.*

- **Replaced the RemoteDebug dependency** with a custom Logger + Telnet server — plus WiFi-stability and hardware-safety improvements; fixed a DebugCLI use-after-free for active telnet sessions and a stack-corruption (FD_SETSIZE) in the telnet sink.
- New Arduino-V3 partition layouts (standard, NOOTA, 8MB).
- Otherwise dependency bumps and include hygiene.

## February 2026

*~13 commits on `main`, 2026-02-01 … 2026-02-28.*

- **Replaced the IRremoteESP8266 library with a native RMT IR decoder** (Key44 remote support, string IR-code mapping).
- FFT implementation optimised (moved to member, weights enabled); SoundAnalyzer implementation moved to its own source file.

## January 2026

*~60 commits on `main`, 2026-01-01 … 2026-01-31. (**v1.3.0** was published Jan 10.)*

**New**

- **Fuzzy effect selection** (CLI + firmware) with tab completion and brightness nudges; text-scrolling improvements.
- Smoke effect + noise-calculation precision improvements.
- Python client (`nightdriver_client`): layout mapping + auto-detection, PNG-sequence and contact-sheet output, fuzzy effect resolution.

**Fixed / build**

- Worked around an ESPAsyncWebServer macro/symbol conflict (renamed `STR` macros, adapted pattern subscribers); replaced the UrlEncode library with a local implementation; many `ENABLE_WIFI` / `ENABLE_NTP` guard fixes so non-networked builds compile.

## December 2025

*~50 commits on `main`, 2025-12-01 … 2025-12-31.*

**New**

- HUB75: horizontal scrolling for long effect titles; QRCode + UrlEncode support.
- Decoupled `EFFECTS_MATRIX` from the SmartMatrix dependency; single `graphics_lib` build expansion; `nightdriver_client` added with auto-brightness and gain for dim displays.
- Better serial-port interactivity + enhanced CLI debugger; MeteorEffect refactored to a modern struct-of-arrays.

**Fixed**

- StarEffect works with silent/no-audio; `FillGetNoise` scaling/centering on non-square matrices; GCC 14 map-allocator constness; Apple5x7 font linker error; merged ESP-IDF4/5 audio layers.

## November 2025

*2 commits on `main`, 2025-11-01 … 2025-11-30.*

- Quiet month — a dependency bump (js-yaml). (The v1.3.0 tag was cut from a late-November commit but published in January.)
