# Light fixtures and DMX nodes: hardware reference

DMX channel maps and specifications for the fixtures and Art-Net nodes on the bench, read from
their manuals so a light preset can be built without re-scraping a PDF. A fixture here has a
matching entry in the **LightPresets** library ([drivers](../moonmodules/light/drivers.md)); the
preset is the channel-role layout, this page is where the numbers behind it come from.

## SHEHDS Mini LED Moving Head 10W RGBW

![SHEHDS Mini LED moving head](../assets/light/fixtures/djlight-mini-led-10w.jpg){ width="280" }

A single 10 W RGBW 4-in-1 LED in a compact moving head: the smallest fixture that exercises the
full pan/tilt/color path, which is why it is the first moving head on the bench.

A PDF circulating under this ASIN describes a 9/14-channel fixture with a combined shutter/dimmer.
That is a DIFFERENT model: this one is 11/13 channels with a plain linear dimmer and a separate
strobe channel. Trust the printed manual; the tables below come from it.

| | |
|---|---|
| LED | 1 x 10 W RGBW 4-in-1 |
| Pan / tilt | 540° / 180°, each with a fine channel |
| Dimming | 0-100% linear, separate strobe channel |
| Voltage | AC 100-240 V, 50/60 Hz |
| Control | DMX-512, sound active, auto, master/slave |
| DMX modes | 11 or 13 channels |
| Display | `d001` address (001-512), `CH11` mode, `Au01` auto, `Snon` sound, `rPAN`/`rTIL` axis reverse |

### 11-channel mode (the projectMM preset)

| CH | Value | Function | Preset role |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0-255 | X-axis (pan), move | `Pan` |
| 2 | 0-255 | X-axis fine tuning | (none) |
| 3 | 0-255 | Y-axis (tilt), move | `Tilt` |
| 4 | 0-255 | Y-axis fine tuning | (none) |
| 5 | 0-255 | axis speed, fast to slow (0 = fastest) | (none) |
| 6 | 0-255 | total dimmer, linear, dark to bright | `Dimmer` |
| 7 | 0-255 | strobe, slow to fast | (none) |
| 8 | 0-255 | red, 0 = closed | `R` |
| 9 | 0-255 | green, 0 = closed | `G` |
| 10 | 0-255 | blue, 0 = closed | `B` |
| 11 | 0-255 | white, 0 = closed | `W` |

CH6 is a straight linear dimmer. Today the driver holds it fully open and keeps brightness in the
color values; routing brightness onto it is the better model and is
[backlogged](../work/future/backlog-light.md). The channels left
unmapped hold at 0, which is what a light driver wants: **strobe off** (CH7) and full-speed
movement (CH5). The fine channels are unused until 16-bit positioning is wired up.

Two things to know when driving it by hand: every channel at 255 makes the fixture **strobe**,
because CH7 is a strobe channel rather than part of the dimmer, and the 13-channel mode's CH12 at
250-255 selects **sound mode**, in which the fixture ignores DMX movement and runs its own program.

### 13-channel mode (not used)

The same first 11 channels, plus CH12 (0-249 auto run, 250-255 sound mode) and CH13 (150-200
reset). Both are program modes that take control away from DMX, so the 11-channel mode is the one
worth driving from projectMM.

## P-Knight Art-Net2 CR021R

![P-Knight Art-Net2 CR021R](../assets/light/fixtures/pknight-artnet2-cr021r.jpg){ width="280" }

A two-universe Art-Net to DMX512 node: Ethernet in, XLR DMX out. It is how projectMM drives a wired
fixture, the counterpart to the LED drivers that speak to addressable strips directly.

| | |
|---|---|
| Protocol | Art-Net (UDP 6454) to DMX-512 |
| Universes | 2 |
| Network | 10/100 Ethernet, static or DHCP |
| Bench address | `192.168.1.92` |
| Bench universe | `01` on its display = `universe_start` **1** in NetworkSendDriver |

**Its universe display is 1-based: node `01` is Art-Net universe 1.** Set the driver's
`universe_start` to the number the node shows, not one less. This is the setting that cost a whole
bench session: a universe mismatch is completely silent, because ArtDMX for another universe is
dropped with no error anywhere, and the symptom is identical to a broken fixture, a wrong DMX
address or a closed shutter. Check the universe FIRST when a fixture does not respond, and confirm
it by reading the number off the node's own display.

Note the fixture's own DMX address is 1-based too but starts at slot 1: address `a0001` means its
CH1 is DMX slot 1, so an 11-channel fixture at address 1 occupies slots 1-11.

**It answers no TCP and no ArtPoll.** Verified on the bench: ports 80, 6454, 8080 and 23 are all
closed to TCP, and an ArtPoll broadcast draws no ArtPollReply. The node is a pure receiver, so it
does not appear in a discovery scan and its address is set from its own display, not over the
network. Send ArtDMX to its address and it outputs; there is nothing to query.
