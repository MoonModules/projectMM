# hpwit/I2SClocklessLedDriver — monthly activity digest

What landed on [hpwit/I2SClocklessLedDriver](https://github.com/hpwit/I2SClocklessLedDriver)'s `main` branch, month by month. External-context reference — a factual log of a friend repo's activity, not projectMM's own history or roadmap. Newest month on top. The reusable prompt that generates these lives in [README.md](README.md).

The library: Yves Bazin's (hpwit) clockless-LED driver that clocks WS2812-class strips out over the ESP32's I2S/LCD peripheral with DMA — the parallel-output technique projectMM's LED-driver analysis studies. Summarised via the GitHub commits API (all commits on `main`), filtering out merge commits, lint/format churn, and 🐰-review fixups. No versioned release is cut from `main` in this window (latest tag is 1.4), so months are kept whole.

> **Authorship note.** Most of the activity in this window is projectMM's own — `ewowi` authored ~53 of the in-window commits, with the rest from the maintainer (Yves Bazin / hpwit) and a couple of others. The IDF 5.5 / arduino-less ESP-IDF / RGBCCT / >65K-LED work below is largely projectMM upstreaming its driver needs into hpwit's library, then tracking the result here.

## April 2026

*~17 commits on `main`, 2026-04-01 … 2026-04-30.*

- **Arduino-less ESP-IDF support hardening**: ML/ESP-IDF compile fixes, `esp_rom_delay_us`, `#ifndef HARDWARESPRITES` guard.
- Moved `gNbDmaBuffer` / `gNumStrips` into the driver class (less global state); CI + documentation set up; integer types tightened to `uintx_t`.

## March 2026

*~9 commits on `main`, 2026-03-01 … 2026-03-31.*

- **RGBCCT support** added; an ESP-IDF `CMakeLists.txt` + small-modifications pass for arduino-less ESP-IDF builds.
- Memory-management improvements; `setGamma` arguments switched to RGB order; semaphore-wait logging tuned.

## January 2026

*~4 commits on `main`, 2026-01-01 … 2026-01-31.*

- **>65K-LED support** — `total_leds` widened to 32 bits; added `extractWhiteFromRGB`.
- ESP32-D0: removed `ESP_INTR_FLAG_IRAM` from `esp_intr_alloc`; `deleteDriver` checks on the DMA tampon buffers.

## December 2025

*~6 commits on `main`, 2025-12-01 … 2025-12-31.*

- **White channel at a configurable offset** (not fixed at index 3); `driver->p_w` bugfix.

## November 2025

*~2 commits on `main`, 2025-11-01 … 2025-11-30.*

- ESP32-S3 I2S init timing tweak (`div_num/a/b`), small stop-delay; reverted an SK6812 clock-speed adjustment.

## October 2025

*~19 commits on `main`, 2025-10-01 … 2025-10-31.*

**New**

- **IDF 5.5 support** — version checks, dynamic DMA-buffer allocation (PSRAM-preferred), `NUM_STRIPS` as a global, `IRAM_ATTR` removed from forwards to compile warning-free.
- `updateDriver` / `deleteDriver` gained length/size and per-strip offset parameters; `initled` with custom colour arrangement; `isVirtualDriver` flag; `setDelay()`.
- Split a `Driver.cpp` out of the header; added clang-format and removed the `COLOR_ORDER_` compiler directives.

**Fixed**

- `_gammab`-to-RGBW bugfix; `pins` array made `uint8_t` for compatibility with other libraries.
