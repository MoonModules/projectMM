# Effects × power functions — inventory

> **Forward-looking backlog document — exception to CLAUDE.md present-tense rule.** One row per effect in the tree on 2026-09-03 (58), recording what each uses today and which power functions it could run on: the ones that exist ([power-functions.md](../moonmodules/light/power-functions.md)) and the ones the [generative-fields top-down](generative-fields-analysis-top-down.md) builds (gradient noise, `PolarLut`, `Oscillators`, `advect` and the velocity rules, `decay`, `lineAA`/`disc`, the 16-bit Layer). It is the input for the catalog sweep that top-down names as a follow-on plan, under the product owner's rule: **every effect runs on the power functions for whatever they cover; an effect that does not is rewritten on them; algorithmic effects keep their logic; a rewrite lands only if at least as beautiful as the effect ran before.** Rows shrink as effects are rewritten; a rewritten effect's row is deleted, not ticked.

**Kind.** N = natural motion (physics, fields, noise, trails, rotation, oscillation): rewritten on the kernels. A = algorithmic (a rule set or a game is the effect): keeps its logic, draws through the library. M = audio meter (bars, levels, spectra): the geometry and ballistics rows apply. U = utility or test: no rewrite owed. Anything in doubt is N.

**Uses today** is read from the source: `noise` (`inoise*`/`fbm`/`warp`), `polar` (`atan16`/`dist16`/`kaleido`), `beat` (`BeatPhase`/`beatsin`), `sin` (`sin16`/`sin8`), `fade` (`fadeToBlackBy`), `particles`, `splat`, `blur`, `geom` (`draw::line`/`rect`/`bar`), `shader`, `scratch` (`ScratchBuffer`), `rnd`, `pal` (`colorFromPalette`), `audio`, and **float** where the effect still computes per light in float.

**Counts.** 58 effects: 36 natural motion, 8 algorithmic (GameOfLife, FlyingToasters, Pacman, Pong, Praxis, RubiksCube, SpaceInvaders, Tetrix), 8 audio meters, 6 utility. 12 still compute per light in float outside the FPU-gated raymarch (BouncingBalls, Blurz, DistortionWaves, PaintBrush, Ripples, RubiksCube, Sine, SphereMove, StarField, Tetrix, Raymarch by design, and one in Wave's history); 7 write raw Layer bytes (the 16-bit phase migrates them to `draw::`).

**What the sweep would look like when it becomes a plan.** Batches by kernel, as each lands: the noise effects with phase 0; the polar and oscillation effects with phase 1; the raw-byte writers with the 16-bit Layer; Echo, Lissajous, PaintBrush and the trail effects with `advect`/`decay`/`lineAA`; BouncingBalls onto `particles` on its own, since it is a rework with a bench judgment. Each batch under ~100 files, each effect compared against how it ran, the golden re-baselined with the reason. Effects a showcase supersedes (Lissajous by Trails, possibly Echo) are deleted rather than kept beside it.
