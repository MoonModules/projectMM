!!! tip "New here?"
    The [Getting started](gettingstarted.md) guide walks you from a blank ESP32 to your first running light show, step by step, with no build tools required.

## What it is

projectMM drives large LED installations and DMX fixtures. You build a light show by stacking simple blocks: a **layout** (how the LEDs are arranged), one or more **effects** (what they animate), **modifiers** (mirror, rotate, mask…), and a **driver** (how the pixels reach the hardware). Every setting takes effect live; there is no reboot to apply a change.

One source tree drives ESP32, Teensy, Raspberry Pi, macOS, Windows and Linux.

-   :material-check-decagram: **See what's verified**

    Every behavior is pinned by a test. When a bug is fixed, a test proves it.
