# Driving projectMM from a phone or tablet

Eight switches, eight knobs and eight faders on a touchscreen, moving the device in real time and following it when something else moves it. It takes about five minutes to go from nothing to a working surface, using a free app and one file.

> New here? Start with **[Install & first light](../gettingstarted.md)**. What follows assumes projectMM is running and you can find it in a browser.

---

## The short version

1. Install **[Open Stage Control](https://openstagecontrol.ammd.net/)** (free; macOS, Windows, Linux)
2. Download **[projectMM-control-surface.json](https://github.com/MoonModules/projectMM/releases/download/latest/projectMM-control-surface.json)**
3. In its launcher set `send` to `<your-device-ip>:9000`, `osc-port` to `9001`, and `load` to the file
4. On the device: **Services → OSC**, turn on `listen` and `feedback`
5. Press start

The faders move the device; moving something in the projectMM UI moves the faders back.

## 1. What this gives you

projectMM's Control card is a surface: a row of switches, a row of encoders, a row of faders, each of which can drive something on the device. The web UI shows it, but a mouse can only touch one control at a time.

A **control surface** is that same row of controls on something you can put your hands on. Open Stage Control is a free app that draws one on any screen, including a phone or tablet browser, and speaks **OSC**, the protocol projectMM listens for.

Two things make this worth the five minutes:

- **Several at once.** Ten fingers on a touchscreen, not one mouse pointer.
- **It follows the device.** Change brightness in the web UI, or recall a preset, and the fader moves to match. The surface and the device never disagree about a value.

Today `switch1` drives the master on/off and `fader1` drives the global brightness. The rest are wired and waiting for assignments.

---

## 2. Find your device's IP address

The surface sends to an address, so you need the one your device is on.

It is in the projectMM UI on the **System** card, and it is the same address you typed into the browser to get there. On a desktop install talking to itself, it is `127.0.0.1`.

Write it down; it goes in step 5.

---

## 3. Install Open Stage Control

Download it from **[openstagecontrol.ammd.net](https://openstagecontrol.ammd.net/)**. It is free and open source, and runs on macOS, Windows and Linux.

**On macOS the first launch needs a right-click → Open**, once. The download is unsigned, so a double-click gets refused with a warning about an unidentified developer. Right-click, choose Open, confirm, and macOS remembers.

---

## 4. Get the session file

A **session** is the layout: which knobs exist, what they look like, and what each one sends. You do not have to build one.

**[Download projectMM-control-surface.json](https://github.com/MoonModules/projectMM/releases/download/latest/projectMM-control-surface.json)**

That link always serves the newest session, built from the latest code, and it sits beside the firmware on the [releases page](https://github.com/MoonModules/projectMM/releases) if you would rather find it there.

Save it somewhere you can find again. The file does not contain your device's address, so the same file works for every device you own.

---

## 5. Point it at your device

Open Stage Control opens a **launcher** first, a settings window, before it draws anything. Three fields matter:

| Field | Value | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| `send` | `<your-device-ip>:9000` | where the surface sends. `9000` is the port projectMM listens on |
| `osc-port` | `9001` | where the surface LISTENS, so the device can answer |
| `load` | the file from step 4 | the layout to draw |

So a device at `192.168.1.42` gets `send` = `192.168.1.42:9000`.

The two ports are different on purpose and this is the one place people go wrong: `9000` is the device's ear, `9001` is the surface's ear. They are not interchangeable.

> Leave `read-only` **off** if you want to rearrange the layout later. On to keep it as shipped.

Press the start button. The surface appears.

---

## 6. Turn the device's side on

In projectMM: **Services → OSC**.

| Control | Set to | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `listen` | on | accept incoming OSC. Without it the device ignores the surface entirely |
| `feedback` | on | answer back, so the faders follow the device |
| `feedbackPort` | `9001` | where to answer. Must match the `osc-port` from step 5 |
| `port` | `9000` | where the device listens. Matches the `send` port |

Leave `feedbackTo` empty. Empty means "answer whoever last wrote to us", which finds your surface on its own. Fill it in only when you want feedback sent somewhere other than the thing driving it.

Move a fader. The device should react immediately.

---

## 7. Use it from a phone

This is where it gets good, and it needs no extra setup.

Open Stage Control also serves the surface as a **web page**. While it is running, look at its console output for a line naming a port (`8080` by default). On any phone or tablet on the same network, browse to:

```text
http://<the-computer-running-open-stage-control>:8080
```

Same surface, on a touchscreen, with ten fingers instead of one pointer. The computer running Open Stage Control stays the middleman; the phone talks to it, and it talks to the device.

> If projectMM's own UI is on port 8080 on that same machine, give Open Stage Control a different port in its launcher, or the two collide.

---

## 8. When you see nothing

The surface draws fine but the device does not move, or the faders sit at zero and never follow. In rough order of likelihood:

**The device is not listening.** `listen` off is the most common cause, and it is off by default. Services → OSC → `listen` on.

**Wrong IP.** Check the System card again. A device that got a new address from DHCP after a reboot is a classic one: the surface is faithfully sending to nobody.

**The two ports are swapped.** `send` must end in `:9000`, `osc-port` must be `9001`. Swapping them produces exactly this symptom: nothing moves, nothing errors.

**`feedbackPort` does not match.** If the device moves but the faders never follow, the outbound direction is misconfigured while the inbound one is fine. `feedbackPort` on the device must equal `osc-port` in the launcher.

**A firewall.** OSC is UDP. macOS and Windows both prompt on first use, and a refused prompt is silent afterwards. Allow Open Stage Control through, or check the firewall's list if you clicked deny.

**The widgets show the wrong values on load.** They should populate immediately, because the session asks the device for its state whenever the page opens. If they do not, the device is not answering: check `feedback` and `feedbackPort`.

To prove the device is reachable at all, from a checkout:

```sh
uv run moondeck/check/send_osc.py <device-ip> /mm/fader/1 0.75
```

Brightness should jump. If that works and the surface does not, the problem is on the surface's side.

---

## 9. One command, if you have the repo

With a checkout, skip steps 3 to 6 entirely:

```sh
uv run moondeck/run/run_open_stage_control.py --host 192.168.1.42
```

It finds the app, passes the session, the address and both ports, and runs it headless. Open **http://127.0.0.1:8088**. You still turn `listen` and `feedback` on at the device.

Full options are on the [OSC module's page](../moonmodules/core/services.md).

---

## What the surface sends

Worth knowing if you ever edit the layout.

Each control sends to an address naming **the surface**, not the thing it drives:

```text
/mm/switch/1 … /mm/switch/8
/mm/encoder/1 … /mm/encoder/8
/mm/fader/1 … /mm/fader/8
```

The device decides what each one drives. That is deliberate: reassign `fader3` from brightness to speed, and the layout does not change, because the layout never knew. It also means a hardware desk added later lands on the same addresses.

You can reach past the surface with `/mm/control/<Module>/<control>` to hit any control directly. That works and is the right answer for a one-off, but it hard-codes into your layout a decision that belongs on the device.

The session also draws a **pad grid**. Those pads are inert for now: `/mm/pad/N` has no route yet, so pressing one sends a message nothing reads. It ships because the grid is the layout a preset launcher will want.

## Where to go next

- **[OSC module reference](../moonmodules/core/services.md)**: every control, the feedback rules, `/mm/hello`
- **[Control card](../moonmodules/core/control.md)**: the surface the device owns, and what each control drives
- **[Control surfaces](../reference/control-surfaces.md)**: what it would take to drive projectMM from a Mackie desk or a MIDI controller
