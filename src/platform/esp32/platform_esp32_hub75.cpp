/// @defgroup platform_esp32_hub75 HUB75 panel output
/// The peripheral half of the panel driver: the bus, the frame buffer, and the continuous scan.
///
/// The driver above applies correction and encodes the rendered frame into bit planes; no domain logic lives here.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## The output is continuous, not one-shot
///
/// That is the design difference from every other output seam in this tree.
/// A strand latches a frame and holds it, while a panel holds nothing: it displays only while it is being clocked.
/// So the controller re-scans the same buffer forever and the driver writes the next frame into it between scans.
/// There is no per-frame transmit call at all; the start arms the loop once and from then on the panel is lit by the transfer engine.
///
/// ## Keeping a discrete-frame interface scanning
///
/// The SDK's transaction model is built for discrete frames, so the scan is kept continuous the producer and consumer way.
/// A refill task queues the same buffer again the moment the previous scan completes, and the peripheral's own interrupt starts it.
/// Nothing re-arms from interrupt context, because the transmit call blocks once the transaction pool is exhausted, and the completion callback runs before the finished slot is recycled.
/// Called from there it always blocks, and a blocking queue wait in an interrupt is a watchdog panic, verified on the bench on every board preset.
///
/// ## Why the narrow capability guard
///
/// A panel port needs fourteen pins on one bus, which rules the classic chip out.
/// So there is no backend to write for it, and the broad macro would only compile dead code onto it.
///
/// ## One scan in flight, which is not a choice
///
/// Each transmit call blocks in task context until its scan finishes and recycles its slot, then queues the same buffer again.
/// And the interrupt starts it at once because the completion is still pending.
/// The gap is one task wake, microseconds against a scan of a millisecond or more, and it is uniform: a fraction of a percent of brightness rather than a flicker.
///
/// A depth of two is not available: the bus owns ONE descriptor list, and queueing a second scan mounts it while the first still owns the descriptors, which fails outright.
/// The same failure can appear once or twice right after start while the engine hands the first scan's descriptors back, after which the interrupt restarts the list as it stands.
/// Which already holds this frame, so the panel loses nothing.
///
/// The refill task's priority sits above the encode task, since a refill that lost the processor for a whole scan would leave the panel dark for that long.
/// It never deletes itself, so teardown can always delete it by handle without racing a self-delete.
///
/// ## Both control lines must be real pins
///
/// A panel has no command phase, so the data-command line signals nothing, but the layer validates it before configuring anything and rejects the whole bus otherwise.
/// Leaving it unset failed every board preset identically with a message that reads like a pin conflict and is not one.
/// So it points at the write strobe, which costs no extra pin since the command phase is never asserted.
/// The layer likewise rejects an unconnected data pin, so the lanes the layout does not use park on the strobe, where it toggles harmlessly with no panel line attached.
///
/// ## The frame must be internal memory
///
/// The peripheral keeps clocking while the transfer engine falls behind on external reads, signals completion with descriptors it still owns, and every following mount then fails.
/// One chip forecloses it anyway, its external region carrying no transfer capability at all.
/// So a frame that does not fit is refused with the depth to lower, which is a panel that says why rather than one that scans torn.
