/// @defgroup platform_esp32_i2s Microphone input and the transform
/// The peripheral half of the audio feature: two seams and nothing else.
///
/// The module above does the level maths, the windowing and the band mapping; this file reads samples off the channel and runs the transform.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## What the microphone is
///
/// A digital part in the standard framing, its data left-justified in a wider slot, mono: the channel reads the one slot the part's own pin selects.
/// It is self-clocked from the bit clock and needs no master clock pin.
/// The slot is configured wide and the raw samples are handed to the domain code, which shifts the value down itself.
/// Everything is under the capability guard with inert stubs elsewhere, and the module never calls in on a chip without it.
///
/// ## The transform scratch is allocated, not reserved
///
/// As a plain array it was eight kilobytes of internal memory reserved from boot on every board.
/// That is a few percent of the pool the network stack and every task stack share.
/// That included the many boards with no microphone fitted, where nothing ever reads it, and a module that is not used should cost nothing.
/// Now a board without audio pays only for the pointer, and one with audio allocates on its first analysed frame and keeps it for the process.
/// So nothing allocates per frame on the audio path.
///
/// ## The gain from the alternate microphone is a conversion, not a boost
///
/// That receiver delivers narrower samples than the standard path, so each is scaled to the same full scale the rest of the chain assumes.
/// Which maps one range onto the other exactly and can never clip.
///
/// A larger gain is tempting and wrong.
/// The level meter measures a raw magnitude in decibels against a window.
/// So a quiet signal reads below that window and the level sits at nothing until the floor is lowered to meet it.
/// That is a WINDOW problem, and scaling up to fix it costs headroom: at a much larger factor the clip point falls below this part's own quiet-room noise floor.
/// The microphone then clipped continuously, and clipping is broadband, so every band showed noise and the onset detector fired in a silent room.
/// Set the display window with the floor control, never with this constant.
///
/// The scaling multiplies rather than shifts, since a narrow sample promotes to a signed type where shifting a negative value or into the sign bit is undefined.
/// While the multiply is defined across the whole range.
