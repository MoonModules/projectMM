/// @defgroup platform_esp32_i80 Parallel WS2812 over the SDK's i80 bus
/// The peripheral half of the whole-frame parallel driver.
///
/// The driver above applies correction and encodes every light into the frame buffer; this file owns the bus, the buffer, transmit and wait.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## One transfer, no refill deadline
///
/// The whole frame is pre-encoded into one buffer and sent as one gapless stream.
/// Once started no processor work remains until the completion callback, so there is no refill deadline for the radio to make it miss.
/// That is the deliberate difference from the interrupt-refilled rings in the lineage this design studied.
///
/// ## One seam, two silicon backends
///
/// The SDK component exposes one public interface and routes it to whichever peripheral the chip has.
/// Both do whole-frame chained transfers with the same control lines and bus widths, so this file's body is generic and serves both, and one driver runs on all three chips.
/// The guard is therefore the broad capability macro rather than the narrow one, precisely so the classic backend compiles here too.
///
/// ## The clock is set by the slot duration
///
/// What constrains it is the WS2812 slot duration rather than the elegance of the divider, and getting that backwards is what broke the first bench run.
/// An expander shifts each slot out over several bus words, so the slot is that multiplier divided by the pixel clock, and the slot IS the zero pulse.
/// The specification caps that pulse near 380 nanoseconds on newer revisions, and the direct path sits just inside it.
///
/// The first attempt was chosen because it divided exactly, and produced a slot over the maximum.
/// The strands rendered scattered full-brightness pixels and washed-out white, zeros being read as ones.
/// An exact divider that produces an out-of-spec waveform is worthless: the divider is a means rather than the goal.
/// The rate now used is also an exact divide and lands the pulse comfortably inside both windows.
///
/// ## Adjust the clock upward, never down
///
/// Lowering it to chase flicker was the original advice and is exactly backwards: a lower rate makes the slot LONGER and pushes the pulse further past its maximum.
/// If the waveform ever needs adjusting, adjust it upward and check the buffer can carry the rate.
/// A wider cascade is not offered for the same reason, needing a rate no exact divide of the bus resolution reaches.
/// Two pins beat two cascaded registers on every axis anyway.
///
/// ## The expander frame will not mount, and the reason is open
///
/// With the expander's eightfold frame every descriptor mount fails whatever the queue depth, and the failure is silent.
/// The transmit call returns success because the enqueue succeeded and the mount fails later in the interrupt.
/// So the driver waits out a timeout per frame while the strands hold stale data.
/// Depth one was tried because the available count reflects only what the previous transfer released.
/// So serialising the mounts should have freed the pool. It did not, and neither did doubling it.
/// Six hypotheses are ruled out by measurement; the open one is the vendor's own note that without descriptor write-back a descriptor stays owned by the engine after use.
/// The full account and what not to retry again are in the driver analysis under the shift-register work.
///
/// ## Where the frame lives, per mode
///
/// Direct mode prefers external memory: the frame is large, its clock is easy to sustain from there, and keeping it out of scarce internal memory is the right trade.
/// Expander mode prefers internal, measured rather than theorised: with the eightfold frame external the strands flicker wildly and the mounts fail in their thousands, while internal renders smooth.
/// The mechanism is not understood. Bandwidth, pool size and queue underrun have each been tested and refuted, and another chip runs the identical frame from external memory perfectly.
/// So this is an empirical preference, labeled honestly as one.
///
/// It is a stopgap rather than the destination, internal memory capping an expander display below what direct mode already reaches.
/// External memory is what makes large displays possible and the driver must get back to it, so it stays the fallback.
/// A frame too big for internal still runs, just poorly, rather than refusing to drive.
///
/// ## The classic chip's i80 is its audio peripheral
///
/// That chip has two instances, and the output bus always takes the second while everything else gets the first.
/// The split is fixed in silicon rather than chosen: only the first instance carries the pulse-density converters.
/// So a microphone of that kind can live nowhere else, while nothing requires the second for anything.
/// The output bus is therefore the one consumer that can always yield.
/// And fixing it leaves the other free for every audio source with no ordering or boot race to reason about.
/// The component picks the first free instance rather than taking one by number, so the second is claimed by holding the first across bus creation and releasing it straight after.
