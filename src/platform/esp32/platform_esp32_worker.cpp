/// @defgroup platform_esp32_worker The pinned worker task and its wake
/// The one seam behind the multicore split, so no task-system type escapes this layer.
///
/// A pinned task with a direct notification is the textbook lock-free wake for one producer and one consumer, and the documented lightweight replacement for a binary semaphore.
/// The render split is the first user and the asynchronous send wants the identical primitive, which is why it lives here rather than in either.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## The watchdog subscription is per task
///
/// Subscribing and feeding act on the current task, so the flag recording whether the caller subscribed is thread-local rather than global.
/// The render loop and the encode worker each feed the watchdog, and a single global would let one call the feed on a task the other subscribed.
/// The system rejects that as an unknown task, flooding the log every tick and starving the network stack.
/// Each task reads and writes its own copy on its own task, so nothing needs synchronizing.
///
/// The configuration runs the watchdog with idle-task checking off, a saturated core being healthy, so nothing is watched unless a task subscribes.
/// If either stops feeding it, a genuine wedge rather than a busy frame, it panics and reboots with a backtrace instead of hanging silently.
///
/// ## Stopping is bounded, never infinite
///
/// Normally one wake suffices, the worker returning once it sees the stop flag.
/// But if the stop runs on the same core the worker is pinned to while the worker is mid-job, it cannot be scheduled until this caller yields.
/// And an unbounded spin would deadlock the device.
/// Yielding lets it drain within a few milliseconds, and the deadline is the robustness floor for a lost wake or a wedged job.
/// On timeout the worker is detached rather than freed, a bounded leak being better than a use-after-free.
/// And its stop flag stays set so it self-deletes cleanly if it ever wakes.
///
/// ## The handle is assigned before the task is created
///
/// A task pinned to the spawner's own core preempts inside the create call, and its function may wait immediately.
/// With the handle still unset that wait returns at once without blocking.
/// And a retry loop becomes a hot spin that starves this caller from ever assigning it, which measured as a board offline at boot.
/// Assigning first closes that window, and a failed create resets it before anyone can be woken.
