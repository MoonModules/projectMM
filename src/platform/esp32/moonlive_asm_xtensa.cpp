/// @defgroup moonlive_asm_xtensa_impl MoonLive Xtensa encodings
/// Named instructions encoded once, composed by the shared lowering.
///
/// Encodings are verified against the assembler rather than transcribed from a disassembly.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## The conventions this encoder assumes
///
/// The architecture is little-endian with mixed wide and narrow instructions.
/// The first four registers map to the windowed argument registers and the rest to the next block.
/// For the short conditional branches used here the offset is measured from four bytes past the instruction.
/// And every one of them places that byte at the same position, so a single fixup kind covers them all.
///
/// ## The top of every frame belongs to the hardware
///
/// The windowed convention reserves save areas at the top of every frame that makes a rotating call.
/// The overflow handler writes two bands there from two different stack pointers: an older frame's first four registers including its return address, and this routine's own next four.
/// So the top thirty-two bytes are the hardware's and never ours, and the compiler obeys the same rule.
///
/// ## Both bands were found on the bench, separately
///
/// Reserving nothing put the parked arguments under the first band, and any script at all reset the board with the return address overwritten.
/// Reserving only half left the highest slot under the second band, which is written on any interrupt landing while a call is in flight.
/// Shallow calls rarely coincided with one and worked, while the deep library chains of one effect gave every tick a wide window to hit.
/// The parked pointer then came back as an expression temporary.
/// The corruption is spatial rather than timed, so no code sequence can dodge it and only the layout can.
/// Never seen on the other architectures, which have no register window and no hardware-owned frame bytes.
///
/// ## The reserve is derived, never written down twice
///
/// It follows the widest call this assembler emits, taken from that instruction itself.
/// A wider call rotates the window further and its save area grows to match.
/// So a future one with a hand-held number would put the top slot back under the band and resurrect this with every static check still green.
///
/// ## Encodings are words, not memory bytes
///
/// Every encoding here is emitted as a word, and a first version built the bytes by hand from a disassembly listing.
/// The two toolchains print differently: one shows the instruction word and the other shows memory byte order.
/// Reading word hex as memory bytes reversed every instruction, and one reversed shift decoded as a load that clobbered the stack pointer, hanging the board hard enough for the watchdog.
/// The host tests can never execute these bytes, so only a device shows it.
///
/// ## The narrow add encodes one to fifteen, and zero means minus one
///
/// So a caller asking to add nothing must emit no instruction at all, and anything outside that range needs the wide form.
/// Every caller passed one until an array whose base offset was zero asked for it, which emitted a subtract and shifted every element access down a byte.
/// That reached a device as a fixture that stayed dark while all host tests passed.
///
/// ## Constants wider than a byte, and negative ones
///
/// The wide move's field is signed and is the only encoding here that holds a negative constant.
/// The compiler emits one to express subtraction, and building that through the zero-extended path would make every subtraction correct only modulo a byte.
/// Invisible in a stored color, silently fatal in a bounds-guarded index or a call argument.
/// A negative beyond that field's reach has no encoding here, and falling through would materialize a different number in silence, so the compile fails instead.
/// The older positive path masked to sixteen bits silently, invisible while the language capped literals there and the first thing a fixed-point literal stepped on.
///
/// ## The narrow slot access reaches only part of the arena
///
/// Its offset field is four bits counting whole words, so it reaches a fixed distance and no further.
/// Past that the field overflows into the neighbouring nibbles and the instruction silently addresses somewhere else entirely.
///
/// That is not a theoretical bound.
/// The control arena puts a script's own members low and the HOST SYSTEM VARIABLES above them.
/// So the first system variable wrapped the field to zero and read the script's first member instead.
/// Every two-dimensional script on this family therefore saw its dimensions as whatever that member held, usually nothing.
/// One shipped script drew its row at the top forever, and another looped zero times.
/// It reproduced on two boards and was correct on the other architecture and on the host.
/// No test caught it, the host using a different backend and the golden bytes never pinning such a load.
///
/// ## The wide forms cover the rest
///
/// They carry a much larger word-scaled offset spanning the whole arena, so they are used whenever the narrow one cannot reach.
/// The narrow one is kept for what it does fit, a member access being the common case.
///
/// ## Which register builds the call target is load-bearing
///
/// A rotating call shifts the window, so the caller's upper registers become the callee's lower ones, and one of them IS the callee's stack pointer.
/// Building the target address through that register handed the callee a fragment of a function pointer as its stack pointer.
/// Its own prologue then sized a frame from garbage and stored through it, landing anywhere in memory, including over this routine's own parked arguments.
/// That is the null arena pointer a script later read.
/// It only bit scripts whose loop both makes a call and reads a system variable, both halves having to be present to notice.
/// The safe temporary maps to an argument slot a three-argument function never reads, which is why it is this assembler's scratch.
///
/// ## The result is parked in the frame, not a register
///
/// It used to be stashed in a register that the rotation maps onto one of the callee's own arguments, so the callee overwrote the stash while it ran.
/// What was then moved to the destination was whatever the callee happened to leave there, measured in a crash dump as a script value reaching the return-address register.
/// Those registers are safe as scratch only BEFORE a call, never across it, and the frame slot sits in bytes the call already owns, so this costs nothing extra.
///
/// ## Conditional branches are relaxed, always
///
/// A conditional branch here carries a single signed byte of displacement, which a loop body outgrows easily once spill traffic is in it.
/// Truncating that silently retargets the branch into the middle of the program, so the choice is to relax or to refuse.
/// This is the textbook relaxation every compiler does, and the fixed longer form skips the iterate-to-convergence step.
/// That is worth a few bytes per branch on a cold path, against not having to reason about shifting offsets.
