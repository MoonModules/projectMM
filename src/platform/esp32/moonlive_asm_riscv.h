/// The ESP32-P4 backend, written against the same named-instruction interface as the other two.

/// ## Fourteen registers
///
/// That is what the caller-saved set alone provides, and a nested loop needs more than the twelve every backend started with.
/// It briefly reached eighteen by mapping callee-saved registers too, on the reasoning that the routine saves what it uses.
/// It does not, having no prologue, so it would have returned with four of them clobbered.
///
/// ## Slots address from the frame pointer
///
/// A call moves the stack pointer underneath them, and reading a spilled value after a built-in call is the ordinary case.
///
/// ## Why the buffer is heap
///
/// The assembler is a stack local, so a cap-sized member put 2 KB on the compile chain's stack and overflowed the task on a classic ESP32.
