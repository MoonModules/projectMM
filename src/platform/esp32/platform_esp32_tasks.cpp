/// @defgroup platform_esp32_tasks RTOS task introspection
/// The one seam that reads the task table, so no RTOS type escapes the platform layer.
///
/// The module above does the domain work; this file answers what the tasks are.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## Two SDK options gate what it can answer
///
/// The snapshot call is the textbook introspection one and needs the trace facility: without it the snapshot is empty and the module shows only its own cost table.
/// The per-task CPU figure needs run-time stats, which cost a timer read on every context switch, measured at about 5 percent of the tick.
/// So that one is gated behind its own build flag and reported as unmeasured when compiled out.
///
/// ## The scratch buffer is lazy and internal
///
/// Allocated once on the first snapshot rather than held from boot, and never re-allocated per tick.
/// The no-heap rule applies because this runs from the one-second tick, and one lazy allocation satisfies it: every later tick is allocation-free.
/// As a plain static array it cost over a kilobyte of internal memory from boot on every board, for an opt-in diagnostic that appears in no device model.
///
/// It is kept for the process rather than freed per call, since freeing would put the allocation back on every tick.
/// The snapshot call wants room for every task or it returns nothing, so the ceiling is generous and exceeding it makes that tick empty rather than partial.
///
/// Internal rather than external memory, though the size would fit comfortably: the call fills this buffer with the kernel lock held, so every write lands inside a critical section.
/// A cache miss there stretches that section, which is the one place on this chip where a stall is most expensive.
