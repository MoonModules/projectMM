/// @defgroup platform_esp32_rmt RMT WS2812 output
/// The peripheral half of the symbol-based LED driver.
///
/// The driver above applies correction and hands down the wire bytes; this file owns the channel, the bit expansion, transmit and wait, and the receive side the loopback test uses.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## The wire-byte path
///
/// Each byte becomes eight symbols on the way to the peripheral, most significant first, using the two bit shapes the timing call programs.
/// Where the peripheral has its own memory access the SDK's encoder does it; on the classic chip the high-priority refill does it inline.
/// So the caller keeps three or four bytes per light rather than thirty-two bytes for each byte of it.
/// And a long strand no longer outgrows the internal memory the refill is restricted to.
///
/// ## The high-priority refill
///
/// The SDK driver keeps everything about the channel and is bypassed for the transmit itself.
/// Its interrupt runs at a level every critical section masks, and that is what let a refill arrive late.
/// The interrupt source on the second core is rerouted by hand to a high-priority vector, which the allocator refuses as special.
/// And this code plays each frame out of the channel's memory one half-block at a time, straight from the driver's frame buffer.
///
/// It lives at file scope outside every namespace, since the assembly bridge calls the handler by its plain name and the peripheral memory is a linker symbol.
/// Both need external linkage an anonymous namespace would silently remove.
/// Everything the handler touches is in internal memory, so it also runs through a cache-off window, which a flash write opens on both cores.
///
/// ## The channel is created on the second core
///
/// A channel's refill interrupt binds to whichever core creates it, and initialization is reached from the main task, which is pinned to the first core alongside the radio.
/// So the driver ticked on one core while its interrupt lived with the radio on the other.
/// And every radio burst above the interrupt's ceiling delayed a refill past its deadline.
/// A chip without transfer hardware keeps clocking the stale block, so the strand shows a few wrong lights at any light count and any transmit power.
///
/// On the bench, more memory blocks softened it, raising the priority did nothing, and halving the lights changed nothing.
/// The vendor's own maintainer names this exact fix: create the channel on the core the radio is not on.
/// A pinned one-shot task rather than the inter-processor call, whose task has a small stack while channel creation allocates and installs an interrupt.
/// Teardown needs no counterpart, the free hopping to the allocating core itself, and a chip with transfer hardware gains nothing but loses nothing either, so the hop is unconditional.
///
/// ## Re-routing after every channel creation
///
/// Creating a channel routes the source back to the driver's own vector each time, and a config change re-creates the channel.
/// A once-only guard let the second initialization hand the threshold events to the driver's handler, which has no transaction and dereferences nothing.
/// A boot loop some ten seconds in, when the network coming up triggered the second sweep.
///
/// ## A timed-out transfer is left alone
///
/// Cancelling one on the classic chip while it is still active triggers a watchdog panic, which is a worse failure than a dropped frame.
/// It self-heals: the next tick re-encodes and transmits again, and if the channel is still busy the call fails and the driver skips waiting on it.
/// The result still matters, though, because a timeout leaves the frame in flight and re-encoding would rewrite bytes the peripheral is still clocking out.
/// Which shows as a few lights in the wrong color rather than a dropped frame.
///
/// ## Riding a live pipeline means re-arming until a whole frame lands
///
/// Each capture takes ONE run of pulses ending at the next long gap, which is the strand's reset.
/// With a controlled transmit the run starts at the frame start, so one arm yields the whole frame.
/// Riding a free-running pipeline, an arm lands mid-frame and captures only the tail.
/// So it re-arms until a run long enough arrives, meaning one that happened to land at or before a frame start.
/// The pipeline transmits continuously, so a full frame is caught within a few arms, and the budget is bounded so a dead wire still times out rather than looping forever.
/// That budget must fit INSIDE the outer ceiling, or the caller frees the capture buffer while this task is still writing into it.
///
/// ## The first pulse of a frame is short behind an expander
///
/// The register's outputs are still settling as the first latch fires, so the very first bit comes back as a zero when the strand sent a one.
/// Measured on one strand: exactly one mismatch in over two thousand bits, always that bit, always short-clipped, while every other bit and both pulse-width classes are textbook.
/// It costs the first light's most significant color bit and nothing else, which is invisible, so a lone short-clipped first bit is the expander's frame-start settling rather than bad output.
/// Any second mismatch, or a first-bit miss that is not short-clipped, still fails.
/// Direct mode drives the pin straight with no latch, so its first bit is clean.
/// And the exception is gated on the expander mode so a real fault on a direct path can never be excused through it.
