/// ## Two ways to land here
///
/// An instruction set nobody has written an assembler for, and a deliberate no-JIT build.
/// That build is a pre-merge gate: it is how a contributor sees what an unsupported desktop sees.
/// Both must link and run everything that is not a script.
///
/// ## Why a desktop may have no backend at all
///
/// The ESP32 side fails the build for an unknown instruction set, every chip being Xtensa or RISC-V, so a third is an unfinished port.
/// A desktop legitimately has this case.
