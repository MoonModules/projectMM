/// The desktop backend: a named-instruction assembler for arm64 and x86-64, in the textbook MacroAssembler shape.
///
/// It appends one instruction at a time and back-patches label offsets, so the lowering composes a multi-op statement without hand-computing a branch displacement.
/// This header is the neutral surface, and the per-ISA encodings live beside it in the implementation.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## One buffer, borrowed
///
/// The emitter writes into the caller's staging buffer rather than a twin of its own.
/// Allocating a second buffer held two code caps at once, and on a classic ESP32 fragmented to a 24 KB largest block that allocation failed.
/// The compile then reported a script too large for a script that compiles fine.
///
/// ## Sized per script
///
/// The code cap is chosen per script rather than shared, the three backends differing by up to 1.9x on identical source.
///
/// ## Why the buffer is heap
///
/// The assembler is a stack local, so a cap-sized member put 2 KB on the compile chain's stack and overflowed the task on a classic ESP32.
