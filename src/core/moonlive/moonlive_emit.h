/// It is defined per platform, so the architecture check stays behind the boundary and this header stays neutral.
/// It exists for the test harness alone, and no shipping code branches on it: a build with no backend degrades at run time, reporting the failure and rendering dark.
/// A test that calls render cannot be compiled there at all, which is why it is a macro rather than a constant.
/// One answers the program, the other answers the build.
