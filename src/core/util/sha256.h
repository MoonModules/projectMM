/// ## Why a copy rather than a library
///
/// This is the only cryptographic primitive projectMM needs, and it needs it on all five targets.
/// OpenSSL does not exist on ESP32, where ESP-IDF ships mbedtls, so linking it would mean an mbedtls path for devices and an OpenSSL path for the desktop.
/// That is two implementations of one function that must agree byte for byte, and a divergence produces identifiers that silently differ between platforms.
/// One vendored file is the smaller thing to own, and the algorithm is frozen.
/// FIPS 180-4 has not changed since 2015 and its test vectors are published, so `unit_sha256.cpp` pins this against them.
///
/// ## What it is not
///
/// The one use today is the MoonStats installation id.
/// This is no general-purpose crypto layer: no HMAC, no streaming over a socket, no constant-time comparison.
/// Nothing here needs them, and an unused primitive is a maintenance cost with no user.
///
/// ## Why one shot and why truncation is safe
///
/// `sha256` takes a whole buffer instead of the usual init, update and final trio.
/// Every caller hashes a short buffer already in memory, so the streaming form would be three functions nobody calls with more than one update.
///
/// `sha256Hex` truncates, which is the standard way to derive a shorter identifier (NIST SP 800-107 section 5.1).
/// At the default of 16 bytes it leaves 128 bits, far past any collision concern for a population of LED controllers.
