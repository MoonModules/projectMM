/// Game of Life is the caller today, hashing its grid each generation to detect that the pattern has gone static or fallen into a short oscillation, the same CRC recurring.

/// ## Which variant, and what it is not for
///
/// This is the textbook polynomial 0x1021 with an init of 0xFFFF and no reflection, the recognisable CCITT-FALSE variant.
///
/// It is no security hash, a CRC being trivially collidable; it is a fast change detector, which is all the stasis check needs.
/// The implementation is integer-only with no table, the bit-serial form being tiny and the call sites running off the hot path, once per generation rather than per pixel.
