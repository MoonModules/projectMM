/// @defgroup InputMapping What a physical input does
/// @{
/// The binding table behind every input service: a row says what one input does to one control.
///
/// Shared by button, infrared and every later transport, because the half that differs between them is only how the event is detected.
/// What happens next is identical, so it lives here once rather than in each module.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## The target is a string, and the surface is the recommended one
///
/// A row names `Module.control`, so an input can drive the control surface or a module control directly.
/// Both are the same mechanism with no special case: the surface is a recommendation rather than a rule.
/// Driving the surface is the better path, since one place then shows what the device's controls do and every transport reaches the same switch.
///
/// The editor offers only the surface. An earlier draft also offered a few module controls directly, which was a second path to the same place.
/// Two ways to say one thing is the split brain the two-step model exists to avoid, and it left a user wondering which a given row used.
/// A row can still name any control through the interface, which is the escape hatch for anything the surface does not carry yet.
///
/// ## A pad is a row, not a control
///
/// A pad grid renders from a list, so a pad is reached through that list rather than by control name.
/// Every such list already publishes each row's slot and accepts an activate field, so this needs to know nothing about presets.
/// Any module that grows a pad grid therefore becomes targetable by every input at once.
/// Resolving it here rather than in each service is what makes a button, a remote and every later transport reach a pad the same way.
///
/// A pad fires on the press alone. A release firing it again would re-apply the same preset for no reason, and would make a momentary row unusable.
///
/// ## An event and a reading are different shapes
///
/// A press carries no number, so a Set row writes the fixed value it was given and zero on release.
/// An analog input's value IS the reading, so a row's stored value has nothing to say, and the two paths stay separate rather than sharing a parameter.
/// They differ in what they do with every kind: a toggle or a delta driven fifty times a second is not something a user can mean.
///
/// A reading arrives in the range every surface control uses and is rescaled to whatever the target holds.
/// So a pedal is configured once and works on any target, rather than needing a range per target.
///
/// ## Reading and writing in the control's own units
///
/// A value is read through the scheduler, which answers at the control's declared width.
/// Reading the raw pointer as a byte was wrong, a wider control holding a large value reading back truncated.
/// The surface's own byte reader clamps too, so a positive delta wrote the wrong number and a negative one could never move a control down.
/// A mapping nudges the CONTROL rather than the surface, so it reads in the control's units and clamps to the control's own bounds.
///
/// A select and a palette store their option COUNT, so the last valid index is one below it.
/// Clamping to the count produced a value the writer clamped again, and a delta that overshot stopped short of the end instead of landing on it.
///
/// ## A Set needs a release to clear it
///
/// A button reports letting go; a remote does not, since a code arrives as a single event with no matching release.
/// So a Set is offered only where a release exists to clear it, or it would write its value and latch forever.
/// An input without one offers toggle and delta, which are both complete in one event.
///
/// ## A target the vocabulary cannot express does nothing
///
/// The whole suffix of a name must parse, and the number must be in that type's own range.
/// A trailing character would otherwise fire the wrong pad, and a number past the range would wrap through the cast and fire another one entirely.
/// One shared bound would let a number past the surface's count through: it parses, it is stored, and it dispatches to nothing.
///
/// A target set through the interface to something the editor cannot represent reads back as unassigned, so the dropdown shows nothing while the row keeps working.
