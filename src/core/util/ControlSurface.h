/// @defgroup ControlSurface A transport that mirrors the surface state
/// @{
/// A control surface is a view of the state ControlModule owns, kept in step in both directions.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## Why a surface mirrors rather than syncs
///
/// ControlModule owns the state: `switch1..8`, `encoder1..8`, `fader1..8`, and what each drives.
/// A surface holds no copy, which is what lets two attach at once and stay in step, a phone running Open Stage Control and a desk on the rack.
/// It is also why inbound is not a method here.
/// A surface writes through the same control path the HTTP API and the UI use, so it gains no privilege and there is no second copy to reconcile.
///
/// ## Feedback is not an echo
///
/// On a motorized desk the motors move because the host sends positions back, and on an Akai APC the pads have no meaning until the host lights them.
/// The surface is often the output device, and this interface is how it gets driven.
///
/// ## Why four verbs
///
/// The hardware has four kinds of feedback, and folding them into one would force every transport to pretend:
///
/// | Verb | What it carries |
/// |------|-----------------|
/// | `sendValue` | a position: a motor, an Open Stage Control widget, an LED bar |
/// | `sendRing` | a position and the style the ring draws, which the APC40 mk2 (CC 0x18/0x38) and the X-Touch MINI (CC 1-8) both carry on a separate CC |
/// | `sendColor` | a color, for an RGB grid, in per-vendor SysEx with no shared structure |
/// | `sendLabel` | text, where the transport has somewhere to put it, such as a scribble strip |
///
/// ## Why the unimplemented three stay
///
/// Everything past `sendValue` has a default, so a transport implements only what its hardware can do.
/// OSC overrides one method, a GPIO surface lights an LED, and an APC transport overrides the color verbs.
/// OSC is the only transport today, so the other three have no implementer yet.
/// They are kept because their shapes come from the hardware rather than a guess, and a default each means a transport that cannot do one writes no code for it.
