/// A sink a producer sends bytes to, without depending on the HTTP server that carries them.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## Who implements it and who holds it
///
/// `HttpServerModule` implements the interface, and producers such as `PreviewDriver` hold a pointer to it rather than to the concrete server.
/// A light-domain producer therefore depends on nothing more than something it can send bytes to.
/// The interface is domain-neutral: what the bytes mean is the caller's business.
///
/// ## Why a send is resumable
///
/// `sendBufferedFrame` takes a payload that lives in a stable caller-owned buffer, so nothing is copied.
/// One WebSocket message is the `header`, copied because it is small and may be a stack local, followed by `body`.
/// `body` is a pointer the caller keeps stable until the send completes or is canceled.
/// The implementation drains it across transport-poll ticks, a bounded chunk per tick, returning on a socket that would block.
/// A large frame therefore stays off the caller's hot path.
/// The browser still sees one atomic message: resumable means delivered over wall-clock, not split into several messages.
///
/// ## The three calls that pace a link
///
/// | Call | What it does |
/// |------|--------------|
/// | `sendBufferedFrame` | begins a send. While one is in flight a new call is dropped, keeping the in-flight frame and rejecting the new one, which the caller reads as a busy link |
/// | `bufferedSendIdle` | true when no send is in flight, so a caller gating the next frame on it self-limits to what the link sustains |
/// | `cancelBufferedSend` | abandons the in-flight send at once, which the caller does before it frees or reallocates `body` on a geometry rebuild |
///
/// ## What a cancel costs a client
///
/// A client caught mid-message by a cancel is closed, the only honest exit once bytes are out.
/// It reconnects, and the generation bump primes it fresh.
/// `PreviewDriver` is the one user today, so every `/wsp` message rides this one paced path.
///
/// ## Inbound messages are opaque
///
/// The transport unmasks a client's frame, framing being its job, and hands the payload bytes to the registered sink; only the producer knows what they mean.
/// `onClientGone` fires when a client's slot closes or turns over.
/// A producer holding per-slot standing state, such as the preview's stride and frame rate request, drops it with the client.
/// Both fire on the transport's own thread, core 0 under the split.
/// A producer ticking elsewhere therefore stores single-byte fields its reader tolerates racing on, which is the lossy-channel rule.
///
/// ## Why the send lease exists
///
/// The lease gives exclusive access to the sender for a producer that does not run on the transport's own thread.
/// Under the multicore split the offloaded `PreviewDriver` ticks on core 1 while the transport drains, reaps and admits on core 0.
/// That is two producers, two cores, one preview socket set and one resumable send slot.
/// The control channel stays core-0-only and outside this lease.
/// A producer therefore brackets a whole message in the acquire and release pair, because arming a frame must not race the drain that is reading the slot.
///
/// The acquire never blocks, because the caller may be on the render or encode thread where blocking violates the hot path.
/// A false result means the transport is busy this instant, so the message is skipped rather than waited on.
/// Skipping is already the producer's back-off path, `PreviewDriver` dropping a slot whenever the link is behind.
/// A lost race therefore costs one frame at most.
/// A single-threaded transport may return true unconditionally: with one producer thread there is no race to prevent, and the pair is then free.
