/// Writes a document with no fixed size ceiling, in one of three modes, so a module tree of any size serializes correctly.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## The three modes
///
/// A socket mode flushes a small staging buffer to a connection as it fills, so a whole response never lives in memory at once.
/// A buffer mode collects into a heap block that grows on demand, for a caller that needs the assembled document and its length up front.
/// A fixed mode writes into a caller-owned slice and raises an overflow flag rather than truncating silently or growing, which the save path wants.
///
/// ## Growth steps down when doubling is refused
///
/// Doubling is the right default, giving amortized constant-time appends, but both buffers are live across the copy.
/// So growing a large block asks for half again as much CONTIGUOUS memory at once, and a device serving a big document has the free bytes without the block.
/// The allocation then failed, every later append was dropped, and the device shipped a truncated document that looked complete.
///
/// A refused doubling therefore steps down toward the minimum rather than giving up: slower to grow, and it fits where doubling cannot.
/// Measured on the bench, both classic boards cut their document at a power of two, losing eight to eleven kilobytes of the tree.
///
/// The step is a QUARTER of the current capacity rather than the bare minimum.
/// Backing off to just enough serves one append and grows again on the next character, which copies quadratically and thrashes the fragmented heap that refused the doubling.
///
/// ## Overflow is a flag, never a silent truncation
///
/// Once tripped, later appends do nothing, so a caller sees one consistent state.
/// A caller that ships the buffer anyway sends a truncated document, indistinguishable from a whole one at the far end.
/// The receiver parses it, throws, and drops the tail.
///
/// The fixed mode never allocates, its capacity being the caller's slice on purpose, since an allocation there would succeed even when the slice is too small.
///
/// ## The number writer takes a double, and firmware must not call it
///
/// Its only caller is the test runner's bridge, which stores numerics that way so it does not lose precision parsing fixtures.
/// A double runs in software emulation on one architecture, far slower than the single-precision type, so production paths use the typed serializers instead.
// Format checking, where the compiler offers it: one toolchain parses the attribute as an unknown specifier and fails the whole class downstream.
