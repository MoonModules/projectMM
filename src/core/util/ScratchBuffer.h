/// One owned allocation with a typed view, so a module sizes its working memory once rather than per frame.

/// A module declares one as a member and calls resize; the destructor, the accounting and the null guard come with it.

///
/// ## One copy of the logic, however many element types
///
/// The type-erased base owns the allocation, the tie to its module and the one heavy body, and is compiled once.
/// The typed face above it is inline sugar that folds into its call sites, so a device using several element types pays for the logic once rather than per type.
///
/// That is the type-erased base with a thin typed face, the same split a standard container uses to share code across element types.
/// Applied here so a memory-holding effect writes one resize call and nothing else.
