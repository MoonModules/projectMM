/// The one-active-instance election, as a member a module declares and claims.

/// Several instances of a type may exist, two microphones say, but exactly one is the one a consumer reaches.
/// The four moves that used to be hand-copied all live here: claim, vacate if mine, vacate on destruction, and a survivor reclaiming an emptied seat.

///
/// ## The claim is idempotent, so a reclaim is just another claim
///
/// The first live instance wins and a later claimant does not displace it.
/// That one semantic serves both roles.
/// A module claims in its build hook to take the seat, and calls the same claim in its tick, where it does nothing while the seat is held.
/// The moment the holder vacates, that tick reclaims it, so there is no separate method for it.
///
/// ## Vacating on destruction is the dangling-pointer guard
///
/// The destructor vacates when this instance holds the seat, so a destroyed module can never leave the accessor pointing at freed memory.
/// That is the bug this primitive exists to make unrepresentable.
///
/// A member destructs before its module's base, so the destructor reads only this object's own seat and reference, never calling into the half-destroyed owner.
/// It is therefore safe in any order of construction, claim, vacate and destruction.
///
/// Copying and moving are deleted, the seat being tied to one instance by reference: relocating it would dangle, exactly as for the sibling scratch buffer.
