/// This is the fifth binding, and the one shape the other four do not have: it writes sixteen entries once per frame, and every effect in that frame samples them.
///
/// ## Why a palette is worth computing
///
/// A stop list is frozen the moment it is saved, where a palette that is code can follow the music, drift, or be computed.
/// The audio builtins are already in the shared table, so `audioBand` in a palette costs nothing to expose, and it is the case that justifies the design.
///
/// ## Why it is cheap enough to run per frame
///
/// Cost is independent of rig size: a sixteen-iteration loop whatever the wall is.
/// It fills a scratch palette and assigns the 48 bytes once, so an effect sees either the previous palette or the new one and never a mixture.
///
/// ## Why a broken script keeps the last good palette
///
/// The other bindings degrade to dark, which is honest when the script is the picture.
/// Here the effects still run, so a black palette would blame them for a fault that is not theirs.
