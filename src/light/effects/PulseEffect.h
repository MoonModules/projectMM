/// Expanding shells from a drifting origin, one per beat, alive with or without sound.
/// @card PulseEffect.gif
///
/// A pulse is a thin shell that grows from a point and dims as it travels.
/// The same shell is a wave on a strip, a ring on a panel and a sphere in a volume.
/// A shell is a distance, and every layout has distances.
/// Between sounds the shells keep arriving on the idle clock, so a silent room still moves.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## Why this is the default effect
///
/// A first boot shows three things at once: the lights work, the device runs, and it hears the room.
/// A dense field shows the first and hides the other two, since every light is already busy.
/// A shell leaves most of the layout dark, so one beat is unmistakable, and the drifting origin proves the device runs before any sound arrives.
///
/// ## One shell, three dimensions
///
/// The radius is a Euclidean distance over whatever axes the layout has, so the code branches on nothing.
/// A 300-light strip has one axis, where a shell becomes a pair of fronts running outward from the origin.
/// A panel gives a ring and a volume gives a sphere, from the same three subtractions.
///
/// ## One set of defaults fits every layout
///
/// Both the travel and the shell's width are shares of the layout's own diagonal rather than counts of lights.
/// A fixed lights-a-second speed crosses a 16x16 panel in half a second and a 300-light strip in seven, so one set of defaults cannot suit both.
/// As a share, a shell takes the same time to cross whatever it is on, and roughly three are alive at any moment on every geometry.
///
/// ## The square root is paid per shell, not per light
///
/// Comparing a radius against a distance and comparing their squares decide the same thing, so the shell test runs in squared space.
/// The root is then taken only for a light that some shell already contains, which is a few percent of the grid.
/// That matters on an in-order pipeline, where a 16-iteration root is 16 branch stalls a light rather than a speculated handful.
///
/// ## What drives a pulse, and what will drive it later
///
/// Three inputs decide everything: when a pulse fires, where it starts, and what color it takes.
/// Audio fills all three today, where an onset fires it, the drift places it, and the dominant frequency colors it.
/// A sensor added later fills the same three, which is why `emit` takes exactly those arguments.
