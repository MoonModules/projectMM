/// The light-domain MoonModule an effect derives from, adding the rendering context.
///
/// A zero-state layer holding accessors that forward to the parent Layer.
/// An effect reads its context through these rather than caching a `Layer*` and the extents.
/// `DriverBase` plays the same role for drivers against the Drivers container.
///
/// Prior art: MoonLight's Node and VirtualLayer, where an effect reaches the layer directly.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## Writing an effect
///
/// Derive from EffectBase and include this one file, which is the whole surface an effect may use.
/// A scripted MoonLive effect gets the same one, and unused declarations emit no code.
/// An effect needing something outside that surface adds one include, and nothing more.
///
/// ## Animation
///
/// Speed controls use BPM rather than an abstract range, so 60 BPM is one beat a second.
/// Multiply a time offset by the panel dimension, or a large display looks sluggish.
/// Drive animation off `elapsed()` rather than a frame count, so speed holds at any frame rate.
/// The speed control sets the dynamics and never the frame rate, which stays maximal.
///
/// ## One include writes an effect
///
/// This file brings `EffectBase` and every helper an effect may use, so an effect includes it alone.
///
/// ## Why the helper includes sit at the bottom
///
/// Layer.h includes this file, since a Layer holds effect children.
/// So this file forward-declares Layer, and pulls Layer.h in after the class is complete.
/// Layer.h re-enters harmlessly through the include guard and defines the accessor bodies.
