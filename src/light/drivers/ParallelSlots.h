/// @defgroup ParallelSlots WS2812 slot encoder: the transpose and the 3-slot wire format
/// @{
///
/// WS2812 encode for parallel buses: the contract between a parallel driver and its peripheral.
/// It is named for the wire unit it builds, one pixel-clock slot being one bus word.
/// The peripheral sets that word's width, and both the i80 and Parlio buses use it.
/// A pure data transform with no platform include, so the host test pins it without an ESP32.
///
/// Prior art: the technique is hpwit's, Adafruit's and FastLED's, studied rather than copied.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## The three slots
///
/// Every WS2812 data bit becomes three bus slots. A 1 bit is high for two of them, a 0 bit for one:
///
///     slot 0: activeMask       every active lane high, the pulse start
///     slot 1: data bits & mask lane L's current bit at bus bit L
///     slot 2: 0x00             every lane low, the pulse tail
///
/// A short lane leaves both slot 0 and slot 1 once its lights run out.
/// It then idles low rather than flashing white, its mask bit being clear.
///
/// ## What the encoders take
///
/// `Slot` is deduced from the call: a `uint8_t` for an 8-lane bus and a `uint16_t` for a 16-lane one.
/// One bus word is one slot, bit L being data line L, so the word width is the lane count and the 8-bit call sites need no change.
///
/// `wire` holds the corrected wire bytes lane-major, indexed as `wire[lane * channels + channel]`.
/// Only lanes set in the active mask are read, so an inactive lane may hold garbage.
/// The lane stride is `channels` rather than a fixed four, so a light of any channel count works.
///
/// ## The shift-register path
///
/// The same wire contract is fanned out through \'595 expanders, so each data pin drives several strands.
/// The fan-out multiplies the slot count rather than the pin count.
///
/// The part is a 74HCT and not a plain 74HC.
/// At 5 V the plain part's input threshold sits above 3.3 V, so a high is not guaranteed to read as a 1.
/// The symptom is flaky strands rather than dead ones.
///
/// The fan-out grows on pins rather than cascade depth, because depth doubles the required pixel clock and there is no exact divide in the band that would need.
/// The board details are on the drivers page.
///
/// ## Two shift-mode optimisations worth knowing
///
/// The prefill writes the frame's constant words once, because only one of a slot's three words carries pixel data.
/// Rewriting the other two per light would burn two thirds of the encoder's stores.
///
/// The active-pin helper is deliberately not called by the whole-slot encoder.
/// There the mask test is fused with the lane gather, so routing it through the helper would walk the pins twice.
///
/// ## Why the 64-bit mask is split into halves
///
/// Splitting once makes every strand test a 32-bit variable shift, which is a single Xtensa instruction.
/// The direct form, masking against a `1ULL` shifted by a runtime value, compiles on the 32-bit Xtensa to an `__ashldi3` library call of roughly 50 cycles.
/// At 144 tests a row that call cost about 7,000 cycles a row, the encoder's dominant cost, attributed on the bench.
/// It is the sibling of the 32-bit SWAR lesson: 64-bit operations synthesize on this target.
///
/// The SWAR pack follows the same shape.
/// Lane `p` is byte `p` of the 8x8 matrix: byte `p` of the first register when `p` is under four, byte `p - 4` of the second otherwise.
/// A 16-lane bus needs a second pair for pins 8 to 15, which the 8-bit path never touches and the compiler drops.
///
/// ## What a prefill run covers
///
/// The `rows` argument is how many rows share one active set.
/// The caller re-prefills per run of rows with the same mask, because an exhausted strand changes the mask at the row where it runs out.
/// Uniform-length strands, the common case, are a single run.
///
/// ## Why the transpose is the emit
///
/// Each shift cycle's eight bit-planes are stored the moment they are computed, while they are still in registers.
/// Staging them in an array first cannot work on this target.
/// Eight cycles of two words each exceeds the register file, so every plane spills to the stack and is reloaded once per bit.
/// Measured on an S3, that staging cost 97 word loads and stores a light against the 17 byte-stores of actual output.
///
/// This is the lesson the lane array taught one level down, where removing it took a light from 8.85 to 6.19 microseconds, and staging the planes was the identical pattern.
/// hpwit's driver stages nothing either, his transpose storing straight into the DMA buffer at its pulse offsets; that was studied rather than copied.
///
/// The price is a strided store, one cycle's eight planes landing a bit-stride apart rather than contiguously.
/// That is one address add per store, far cheaper than a spill and a reload.
///
/// ## Why the transpose is SWAR
///
/// The data slot is an 8 by 8 bit-matrix transpose, and the measured render-loop hot spot.
/// It is around 85% of the driver frame at scale.
/// So it uses the branch-free delta-swap from Hacker's Delight rather than a per-bit gather loop.
/// Same result, no table, far fewer operations.
///
/// The 8 by 8 bit-transpose on the packed representation, which keeps it in registers.
