///
/// A light is a run of channels, and this names the role of each: the color roles a strip or panel needs, and the fixture roles a moving head adds.
/// Two sides use it.
/// `Correction` describes a light's wiring as an array of these, where `roles[i]` is what channel `i` is.
/// The effect-side writers such as `setRGB` and `setPan` name the role they drive.
///
/// `None` marks a channel carrying no role we drive, a spacer or a fixture channel set elsewhere.
/// The color roles come first, so a plain RGB or RGBW light only ever uses the low values and the fixture roles extend the list without disturbing them.
///
/// ## The enum is append-only
///
/// A persisted preset stores each channel's role as this enum's byte value, so a role is never renumbered.
/// A new one is appended within its group, color roles before fixture roles, and existing values keep their index.
///
/// `White` is a normal or cold white and `WarmWhite` the second white a CCT fixture adds, while `Yellow` and `UV` are the extra par-can colors of a six-channel RGBWYP lightbar.
/// Extending here is safe today because the fixture roles carry no persisted data: no seeded built-in uses them and no effect writes them, so shifting them is a no-op.
/// A future persisted fixture role would force new roles to the very end instead.
