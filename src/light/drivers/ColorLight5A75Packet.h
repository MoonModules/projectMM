/// @defgroup ColorLight5A75Packet The ColorLight 5A-75 wire format
/// @{
/// The one home for the layout, which `PanelCardDriver` builds frames against.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// This is the same shape as `ArtNetPacket.h` and `DdpPacket.h`, with one structural difference.
/// The format has no receiver in the tree, the cards being the receiver, so there is no build-and-parse round trip to test against.
/// The unit tests pin the built bytes against the layout instead.
///
/// ## Raw Ethernet, not UDP
///
/// These are complete layer-2 frames sent below IP: no address, no port, no DHCP lease.
/// That is why the driver works on a link that never got one.
///
/// ## The overloaded EtherType, the format's defining quirk
///
/// A normal frame carries a two-byte EtherType at offset 12 and 13.
/// Here byte 12 is the packet type and byte 13 is already the first payload byte, so every packet's body starts at offset 13 rather than 14.
/// A row packet therefore reads on the wire as EtherType `0x55` followed by the row's high byte.
/// That is not because the row is deliberately encoded there, but because it is simply the first payload byte and lands in that position.
/// Getting this wrong shifts every field by one, and the cards silently discard the frame.
///
/// ## The MACs are fixed constants, not real addresses
///
/// The destination is `11:22:33:44:55:66` and the source `22:22:33:44:55:66`.
/// The cards filter on that destination, so a frame sent to broadcast, or from the device's own MAC, is dropped with no visible error.
/// The source is not this device's MAC.
///
/// ## The frame layout
///
/// Every packet type shares the first thirteen bytes:
///
/// | Bytes | Meaning |
/// |-------|---------|
/// | 0 to 5 | destination MAC, always the fixed constant |
/// | 6 to 11 | source MAC, always the fixed constant |
/// | 12 | packet type: `0x55` row data, `0x01` sync, `0x0A` brightness, `0x07` discovery |
/// | 13 onward | payload, per type |
///
/// ## The row-data payload
///
/// Row data, type `0x55`, carries its payload from offset 13:
///
/// | Bytes | Meaning |
/// |-------|---------|
/// | 13 to 14 | row number, big-endian |
/// | 15 to 16 | pixel offset within the row, big-endian |
/// | 17 to 18 | pixel count in this packet, big-endian |
/// | 19 | `0x08`, a constant whose purpose is undocumented |
/// | 20 | `0x88`, likewise |
/// | 21 onward | pixel data, three bytes per pixel |
///
/// ## The sync and brightness packets
///
/// Sync, type `0x01`, is 112 bytes with its body zeroed except in four places.
/// Byte 13 is `0x07`, marking a PC or netcard sender where hardware writes `0x00`.
/// Byte 35 is the brightness, byte 36 a constant `0x05`, and bytes 38 to 40 the brightness again.
///
/// Brightness, type `0x0A`, is 77 bytes, zeroed except for the brightness three times at bytes 13 to 15 and `0xFF` at byte 16.
///
/// ## The order within a frame
///
/// Brightness first, then every row ascending, then sync last, the sync being what latches the buffered rows onto the panels.
///
/// The brightness packet is reported not to work on older card firmware, so the driver treats it as advisory and never depends on it having landed.
///
/// No configuration packets are sent: the cards are configured by the vendor's own tool and keep that in flash, so a sender only streams pixels.
///
/// ## What a builder requires of its caller
///
/// Each builder writes into a caller-owned buffer and returns the bytes written, so the buffer must be large enough before the call.
/// A row frame needs the row prefix plus three bytes a pixel, which the largest-frame constant covers.
/// A sync frame needs its own fixed 112 bytes, and a brightness frame its 77.
///
/// Pixel bytes are copied verbatim, because channel order is the caller's business and the driver's `Correction` has already applied it.
/// Nothing here reorders them, and nothing here should start to.
///
/// ## Why the largest frame exceeds the MTU
///
/// The largest frame is 1512 bytes, above the 1500-byte Ethernet MTU on purpose.
/// These are raw layer-2 frames on a dedicated link to dumb receivers, never IP packets a router would fragment.
///
/// FPP packs rows the same way, while Harald Kubota's write-up sends 128 pixels a packet, 391 bytes, which stays inside the MTU.
/// Both work against the cards, and the larger packet is fewer frames for the same wall.
///
/// This is worth knowing if a wall ever goes dark behind a switch that will not pass a 1512-byte frame.
/// Nothing in the path reports that: the card simply never sees a row and its activity LED stays still, which looks exactly like a transmit path that is not running.

// Fixed MACs. The cards filter on the destination, so these are not arbitrary.
