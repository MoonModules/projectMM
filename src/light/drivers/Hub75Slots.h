/// @defgroup Hub75Slots HUB75 scan encoder: the bit-plane wire format
/// @{
///
/// HUB75 encode: the contract between the driver and a HUB75 port, named for the wire unit it builds.
/// One pixel clock is one SLOT. Sibling of ParallelSlots.h, which does the same job for WS2812.
/// A pure data transform with no platform include, so unit_Hub75Slots.cpp pins it without an ESP32.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## The wire layout
///
/// One encoded frame, outermost first:
///
///   for each bit plane p (0 = least significant)
///     for each scan row r
///       for each column x          -> one bus word per column: the six color
///                                     bits for (x, r) and (x, r + rows)
///       one blanking word           -> OE high (dark) while the row address
///                                     changes and the shift register latches
///
/// ## Address rides with the data
///
/// The row address and the control lines share the bus word that carries the color bits.
/// The peripheral clocks one word per slot, and a panel wants address and data at once.
/// `Hub75Layout` says which bus bit each line sits on, the one thing a board's wiring changes.
/// How a panel scans, and why brightness is time, is on the driver's page under "HUB75, details".
///
/// ## Prior art
///
/// mrcodetastic/ESP32-HUB75-MatrixPanel-DMA, hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix and ESPHome's hub75.
/// The scan and bit-plane structure is the panel's, and the encoder is written from that behavior.

/// Which bus bit each HUB75 line occupies. The peripheral drives one 16-bit bus word per slot.
/// Every line is a bit position rather than a GPIO here, and the platform layer maps bit to GPIO.
///
/// Defaults are the conventional order and cost nothing to override. A board that wires the panel differently changes these, and the encoder is unchanged.
