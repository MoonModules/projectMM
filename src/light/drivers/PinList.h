/// @defgroup PinList Pin + light-count list parsing
/// @{
///
/// The light-domain half of pin and count list parsing for multi-output LED drivers.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// `RmtLedDriver` takes one RMT channel per pin and `I80Peripheral` one i80 data lane per pin, each driving consecutive slices of the source buffer from two text controls.
/// The GPIO CSV parser `parsePinList` is a domain-neutral core primitive, while the count distribution here speaks `nrOfLightsType` and so stays in the light layer.
/// Both return null on success, or a static error literal for `setStatus`.
/// `unit_RmtLedDriver_pins.cpp` pins them on the host.
///
/// ## How a count list is read
///
/// `assignCounts` fills one count per pin from the `ledsPerPin` text.
/// It uses the broadcasting idiom NumPy and CSS share, where a scalar applies to all and a list maps element-wise, plus an auto-fit empty case.
///
/// | Written | What it means |
/// |---------|---------------|
/// | empty | an even split, the total over the pin count, the last pin taking the remainder |
/// | `N` | that many on every pin, broadcast |
/// | `3,4,5` | mapped per pin in order, a list shorter than the pins even-splitting the rest over those unlisted |
///
/// A list longer than the pin count ignores the extras, since a stale list after the pins shrank is not an error.
/// Explicit counts are clamped so the running sum never exceeds the total.
///
/// ## The per-pin ceiling
///
/// `maxPerPin` is the driver's protocol ceiling on lights per data line.
/// A pin exceeding it is clamped, so the driver drives the first `maxPerPin` and stays lit rather than choking on the rest.
///
/// It is per-protocol, so each driver passes its own.
/// A WS2812-class one-wire line, whether RMT, LCD_CAM or Parlio, clocks a fixed 30 microseconds a light, so 2048 a pin is already about 16 frames a second.
/// A clocked two-wire SPI type such as APA102 or SK9822 runs at tens of MHz and manages ten thousand or more a pin, so it passes a far higher cap.
/// Passing 0 means no ceiling.
/// The intended way to output fewer lights is the driver's start and count window rather than this safety cap.
///
/// On a clamp the caller's `warn` is set, a warning it shows while still running.
/// That is distinct from the return value, which stays null, because clamping is not an error that idles the driver.
///
/// ## What clamping does to the later pins
///
/// Offsets accumulate from the clamped counts, so clamping one pin shifts every later pin's source slice down by the trimmed amount.
/// For the headline case, a whole grid funneled onto one pin, that is exactly right: the pin drives the first `maxPerPin` and nothing follows it.
///
/// For the pathological case of several pins each over the ceiling, the later strips show a shifted window rather than a truncated one.
/// That is accepted rather than fixed: it degrades rather than crashes, and nobody wires the misconfiguration on purpose.
/// Preserving alignment would need a parallel array of unclamped counts, which is more state for a case the warning already flags.

/// The per-pin light ceiling for a WS2812-class one-wire protocol, past which output is a slideshow.
