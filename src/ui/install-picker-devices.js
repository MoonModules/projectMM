// install-picker-devices.js — the device-catalog + chip-detection half of the
// release picker. WEB-INSTALLER ONLY. It is imported by the GitHub Pages
// installer (mooninstaller/index.html) and passed into installPicker.init() as
// the `deviceSupport` option; the shared install-picker.js never imports it.
//
// Why a separate file: install-picker.js is embedded into the firmware binary
// (src/ui/embed_ui.cmake gzips it verbatim — there is no bundler or tree-shaking
// in this project, so whatever is in that file ships on the device). The device
// catalog and chip detection are only meaningful during a first USB flash from
// the browser; on-device OTA already knows its deviceModel (SystemModule). Keeping this
// code out of install-picker.js keeps it out of every device's flash. The
// injection seam (init({ deviceSupport })) is the standard "host supplies the
// optional capability" pattern: the Pages page wires it in, the device passes
// nothing, so the device code is genuinely absent from the firmware.
//
// Pure DOM + a same-origin fetch — no serial / esptool / Improv (those live in
// install-orchestrator.js and reach this code only via the onDetect callback
// install-picker.js already owns).

// Devices catalog — same-origin mooninstaller/deviceModels.json. ~1 KB, no rate-limit
// concern (CDN serves it on the public site, preview_installer serves it from
// disk locally), so no sessionStorage cache: caching adds invalidation bugs
// without saving bytes. Graceful degradation: any fetch / parse failure returns
// [] and the picker silently omits the device <select>.
